Riot Platforms (RIOT) rose 16.54% to $14.05, while Cipher Mining (CIFR) added 15.47% to $14.66.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) increased 15.43% to $20.08, and Core Scientific (CORZ) gained 10.43% to $16.36. Neptune Digital Assets (NDA) also advanced, rising 11.43% to $0.78</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the drop, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a spot Bitcoin ETF managed by BlackRock that lets investors gain exposure to Bitcoin without holding the crypto directly, crushed its daily volume record with about $10\u202fbillion worth of shares traded \u2014 even as its price <a href=\"https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/2019522889435812298\">plunged</a> 13%, marking the second\u2011worst one\u2011day drop since the fund\u2019s launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, bitcoin is trading at $70,661.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"bitcoin price\n\" class=\"wp-image-50349\" height=\"1008\" src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Bitcoin-Magazine-Pro-Screenshot-81-1024x1008.png\" title=\"Bitcoin Price Roars Above $71,000 After Days of Sell-Offs 6\" width=\"1024\" /></figure>\n<p>This post <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-price-roars-above-71000\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bitcoin Price Roars Above $71,000 After Days of Sell-Offs</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bitcoin Magazine</a> and is written by <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/micahzimmerman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Micah Zimmerman</a>.</p>", "sentiment": "negative", "categories": "etf,regulation,institutional,exchange,mining", "coins": "BTC,ADA,LINK,MATIC,NEAR"}}

Instead of awarding about 2,000 Korean won, or roughly $1.40, some users received at least 2,000 Bitcoin each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The error <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/crypto-firm-accidentally-sends-44-billion-bitcoins-users-2026-02-07/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">resulted</a> in the accidental distribution of roughly 620,000 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $44 billion at current prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bithumb <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/south-korean-crypto-exchange-accidentally-174618936.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">apologized</a> for the mistake and said it has now recovered 99.7% of the excess Bitcoin.

Bithumb <a href=\"https://biz.chosun.com/stock/finance/2026/02/08/LNXJLG7B2BDCHIUC63JQYMBEB4/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> local media it had not yet recovered 125 Bitcoin, worth around $9 million, from a small group of customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exchange said it would cover those remaining losses using its own corporate funds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bithumb\u2019s Bitcoin disruptions\u00a0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The incident caused an immediate disruption in Bitcoin trading on the platform. Charts from Bithumb showed Bitcoin briefly slumped 17% to 81.1 million won or roughly $55,000 during the selloff before recovering. The price later rebounded to around 104.5 million won.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Korea\u2019s financial regulators responded swiftly. The Financial Services Commission said the incident exposed vulnerabilities in the virtual asset sector. Officials said they would review internal control systems at domestic exchanges and launch on-site inspections if irregularities were found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Korean newspaper Kookmin Ilbo <a href=\"https://www.kmib.co.kr/article/view.asp?arcid=0029367457\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> regulators had already begun an inspection at Bithumb\u2019s offices on February 7. Investigators reportedly requested a list of employees authorized to issue crypto payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unnamed sources quoted by the newspaper described the incident as revealing \u201cstructural vulnerabilities\u201d in the exchanges operational processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reports indicated that Bithumb\u2019s internal system allowed employees to issue loyalty points, Korean won, Bitcoin, and Ethereum without formal settlement procedures, increasing the risk of payout errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Executives acknowledged internal shortcomings. In an email to employees, Exchange Business Division Vice President Hwang Seung-wook <a href=\"https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/bithumb-to-write-off-125-million-in-bitcoin-losses-after-giveaway-gaffe/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20fact%20that%20a%20single,fail%20to%20prevent%20such%20errors.%E2%80%9D\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> the mistake demonstrated weaknesses in the company\u2019s processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe fact that a single error in setting an event reward unit can destabilize an entire crypto exchange demonstrates the current state of our systems,\u201d he wrote. He said the company would focus on eliminating failures in oversight rather than blaming individuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bithumb\u2019s compensation plan</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bithumb announced compensation measures for customers affected by abnormal trading conditions during the incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exchange said users who sold Bitcoin at unusually low prices during the disruption would receive the full sale amount plus an additional 10%. Bithumb also said it would waive trading fees across all markets for seven days beginning February 9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company said it would provide 20,000 Korean won, or about $15, to customers who were actively using the platform at the time of the incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The error comes at a sensitive time for the exchange. The exchange has been pursuing plans to become the first South Korean crypto exchange to go public in the United States this year.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, South Korea\u2019s consumer protection watchdog <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/south-korea-consumer-watchdog-probes-171115911.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">launched</a> a probe into Bithumb\u2019s marketing claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, Bithumb is in damage control mode.

While this doesn't guarantee a particular price, it does increase the odds of price behaving as if there are invisible grooves in the road, because in a derivatives-heavy market, hedging flows can add friction in some ranges and remove it in others.</p>\n<p>That brings us to max pain.

CoinGlass data shows a put/call ratio around 0.44, one more hint that the distribution is lopsided rather than smooth, and lopsided is the whole point because it's how a date stops being a calendar fact and becomes a market event.</p>\n<p>There's a simple, non-trader way to hold all of this without turning it into fortune-telling.</p>\n<p>As March approaches, crowded strikes can behave like zones where price movement feels oddly damped, then oddly jumpy, because the hedging response is not steady.</p>\n<p>If Bitcoin wanders into a heavily populated region, the market\u2019s automatic risk management can reinforce a range, and if Bitcoin moves hard enough to escape it, those same mechanics can flip into something that amplifies momentum instead of resisting it.</p>\n\n<div class=\"cs-article-embed\">\n    <a class=\"cs-article-embed__link\" href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/binance-trading-data-reveals-why-bitcoin-prices-are-sliding-even-as-spot-buyers-flood-the-market-with-bids/\">\n                    <div class=\"cs-article-embed__media\">\n                <img alt=\"Binance trading data reveals why Bitcoin prices are sliding even as spot buy", "sentiment": "neutral", "categories": "regulation,institutional,defi,exchange", "coins": "BTC,ETH,LINK,MATIC,DOT,NEAR,MKR"}}

Flow tables almost always aim at the second layer, the net creation or destruction of shares. The SEC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/etfs.pdf\">investor bulletin</a> makes the key distinction very clear: ETF shares trade on an exchange, but supply changes through the creation and redemption process.</p>\n<p>That split matters because a day can see crazy volumes and price action and still print zero flows for a given fund if buyers and sellers just match each other in the secondary market. And a day can print a huge outflow because one or a few large holders decide to redeem, even if there's steady buying elsewhere.</p>\n<p>This is why dispersion is worth tracking. Instead of staring at the net number, count how many funds are green versus red, then ask how concentrated the red is. On Jan. 30, the numbers were brutal everywhere: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/products/ishares-bitcoin-trust/\">IBIT</a> -$528.3 million versus a -$509.7 million total, which means the rest of the complex was slightly positive when you add it up. <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/products/fidelity-wise-origin-bitcoin-trust/\">FBTC's</a> $7.3 million, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/products/ark-21shares-bitcoin-etf/\">ARKB's</a> $8.3 million, and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/products/valkyrie-bitcoin-fund/\">BRRR's</a> $3 million inflows were small, but they were still inflows.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of February, we saw a much cleaner example of what broad-based demand looks like and what a <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-supply-guide-a-simple-dashboard-for-btc-supply-shows-when-holders-sell-miners-strain-and-etfs-add-pressure/\">concentrated exit</a> looks like.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 2, net inflows were spread across the leaders, including IBIT's $142.0 million and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/products/fidelity-wise-origin-bitcoin-trust/\">FBTC's</a> $153.3 million, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/products/bitwise-bitcoin-etf/\">BITB's</a> $96.5 million, and ARKB's $65.1 million inflows joining in. That's what a category-wide &#8220;buy day&#8221; looks like in the flow data: more than one desk, more than one platform, and more than one fund.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 3, the table turned into a lesson in internal conflict. IBIT was still up $60.0 million, while FBTC printed -$148.7 million and ARKB -$62.5 million, pulling the total to -$272.0 million. The category was net red while the biggest vehicle stayed green, which is the mirror image of Jan. 30\u2019s story. The takeaway here is not that one ticker smart money and the others aren't, but that the ETF market now has different buyer types with different rules, and they don't all hit the button at the same time.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 4, the outflows deepened to -$544.9 million, with IBIT -$373.4 million and FBTC -$86.4 million leading the day, plus smaller outflows across other funds. That was the day Bitcoin dipped under $72,000 in a broad risk-off backdrop.</p>\n<p>When analyzing the ETF market, it's important not to treat every green print as fresh conviction. A micro-inflow can be real demand, but it can also be allocation drift getting corrected, a model portfolio topping up a sleeve, or a platform with scheduled behavior that doesn't really care what crypto Twitter is doing this week. Big totals are often driven by a much smaller number of actors than people assume, and small prints can be driven by a much larger number of small accounts than the headlines imply.</p>\n<h2>The real reasons micro-inflows happen, and what February\u2019s slump did to them</h2>\n<p>The easiest explanation is the least satisfying and the most frequent: one large redemption can dominate the day. Jan. 30 was a single-ticker gravity well, with IBIT\u2019s $528.3 million outflow overwhelming everything else. Feb. 4 did something similar, with IBIT's $373.4 million outflowdoing most of the work.</p>\n<p>Next comes distribution behavior. Some funds get embedded in advisor platforms and model portfolios where allocations update on schedules, sometimes monthly, sometimes quarterly, sometimes when a portfolio crosses a risk band. That sort of demand can remain steady even when fast money is de-risking, and it can show up as small greens on days when the total looks ugly.</p>\n<p>Then there's internal switching. Investors rotate between products for reasons unrelated to Bitcoin\u2019s fundamentals: fees, familiarity with a particular issuer, operational comfort, or an institution consolidating exposure for reporting simplicity. A switch day can look like there are buyers in one fund and sellers in another, while the true story is that it's the same exposure, just with a different wrapper.</p>\n<p>The Feb. 4\u20135 slump adds one more ingredient that makes dispersion louder: forced deleveraging in the rest of the crypto market. When the market slides quickly and liquidations pick up, desks that need to raise cash sell what they can, and that can include ETF positions.</p>\n<p>That backdrop helps ", "sentiment": "negative", "categories": "etf,regulation,institutional,defi,whale,mining,selloff", "coins": "BTC,ETH,SOL,LINK,DOT"}}

That mismatch is how a CME gap is born, and why it keeps turning up in the middle of the most stressful weeks.</p>\n<p>A CME gap is the blank space on a CME futures chart between Friday\u2019s final traded level and the first traded level when the market reopens Sunday evening (US time). CME futures trade on a weekly schedule with a weekend break, while spot Bitcoin keeps moving. When the first CME print lands far from Friday\u2019s close, the chart draws a jump and leaves an empty zone in between. That zone is the gap.</p>\n<p><em>CryptoSlate\u2019s</em> <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/market-reports/whats-a-cme-gap-and-why-does-it-get-filled/\">report</a> on this topic made the key point that the gap is not a mystical force, but a record of time when one market was closed, and the other was still trading. This is not about prophecy. It\u2019s about a calendar mismatch that becomes visible on charts.</p>\n<p>This week gave us a clean, real-world demo.</p>\n<p>On the continuous CME Bitcoin futures chart, the Friday (Jan. 30) close printed around $84,105, and the first Sunday reopen printed near $77,730, leaving a roughly $6,375 weekend gap. Then the drawdown accelerated.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin slid from about $72,999 at the start of Feb. 5 to a low of $62,181 on Coinbase, and then printed near $60,000 early Feb. 6 before rebounding into the mid $60,000s. CME\u2019s 30-minute series shows the same shape, with a low near $60,005 and a rebound toward $66,900.</p>\n<p>Even with that kind of volatility, the prior Friday level in the mid $80,000s stayed far overhead. The gap remained open through Feb. 6 because the price never got close enough to revisit it.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a good place to start, because it answers the question most non-traders are really asking when they hear the term \u201cgap.\u201d They're asking why two prices that both say BTC can look like they live in different universes for a moment, and why that mismatch sometimes disappears as the week goes on.</p>\n<h2>How a gap forms when one Bitcoin market takes the weekend off</h2>\n<p>CME lists cash-settled Bitcoin futures that trade in a near-continuous weekly session: Sunday evening through Friday afternoon, with a daily break, and a hard weekend stop. But spot Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have that off switch, so if a big move hits on Saturday, CME can\u2019t print it in real time. The chart just has no data for that stretch.</p>\n<p>When CME reopens, it doesn\u2019t resume trading from the Friday close. It resumes from wherever the market is at the opening hour. If spot is down 8% or up 6% while CME was closed, the first futures trade will reflect that, plus whatever premium or discount futures carry at the reopen. The result is a visible jump, and the empty zone between Friday\u2019s last level and Sunday\u2019s first level becomes the gap.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_518695\" style=\"width: 1588px;\"><img alt=\"CME gaps bitcoin futures\" class=\"size-full wp-image-518695\" height=\"856\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CME-gaps-bitcoin-futures.png\" width=\"1588\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-518695\">Graph showing Bitcoin futures on CME from Jan. 15 to Feb. 6, 2026 (Source: <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/nDPOT2hW/\">TradingView</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The important part is what happens next, because the gap existing in the first place is a calendar fact, but the gap getting filled is market behavior.</p>\n<p>Think of the gap as a skipped page in a book. Friday ends on a cliffhanger, the weekend writes three chapters somewhere else, and CME comes back with a whole new chapter. The skipped pages are still missing on the CME chart, but the story has already advanced on spot exchanges.</p>\n<p>This is also why the gap meme can feel persuasive in weeks like this one. When Bitcoin is calm, the reopen is close to Friday\u2019s close, so there is no dramatic blank space to talk about. When Bitcoin is violent, the blank space is big, and the human brain treats big blank spaces as unfinished business.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth vs. reality:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Myth: </strong>\u201cCME gaps have to fill.\u201d</li>\n<li><strong>Reality: </strong>Gaps often fill because markets tend to converge once CME liquidity returns, but they do not <em>have</em> to fill on any schedule. In trend weeks, the gap can sit open for a long time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why gaps often get filled, and why this week shows the limits</h2>\n<p>A &#8220;gap fill&#8221; simply means price later trades back through the empty zone, often all the way to the prior CME close. <em>CryptoSlate\u2019s</em> explainer argued that this happens so often because, once CME is live again, there are practical incentives to pull futures and spot back toward each other.</p>\n<p>That pull is just a set of boring, repeatable reasons that tend to show up during staffed market hours.</p>\n<p>If futures and spot are far apart, there\u2019s money to be made in narrowing the difference. Companies that can access both markets can buy low and sell high, aiming to profit as the spread compresses.</p>\n<p>This is a convergence process driven by arbitrage and relative-value positioning rather than a belief that Bitcoin must go up or down. You can understand the intuition without touching the trade, because two linked markets rarely tolerate a huge disagreement for long once liquidity is back, and risk limits are active.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s the attention effect. Gaps are now widely tracked and shared, which emphasizes their importance during price volatility. When lots of people watch the same level, liquidity tends to gather there. That liquidity can make it easier for the price to revisit the area, especially in choppy markets where mean reversion is already in play.</p>\n<p><em>CryptoSlate\u2019s</em> previous report backed the claim that gaps fill with numbers from its own study, showing a high fill rate and a tendency for many fills to happen quickly once CME sessions resume. That helps explain why the gap myth survives: it has enough historical reinforcement to feel like a rule, even though it isn\u2019t one.</p>\n<p>This is where Feb. 5 and Feb. 6 matter, because they show the boundary case that keeps the story honest.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin dropped hard, touched $60,000, and then snapped back, causing over $1 billion in liquidations in just 24 hours.</p>\n<p>That is the kind of environment where the CME gap starts mattering less. When the market is dumping and leverage is being forced out, price doesn\u2019t care about a few missing candles in CME\u2019s chart from the week before. It cares about where bids actually exist right now.</p>\n<p>Both Coinbase and CME fell into the low $60,000s, then bounced toward the mid $60,000s. So, the old CME Friday close near $84,105 stopped being a magnet for price and started looking more like a distant marker.</p>\n<p>This is also why the open gap can be a better explaining tool than predicting one.</p>\n<p>In a calm market, fills can happen quickly because the price is already oscillating and liquidity is comfortable revisiting prior levels.</p>\n<p>In a stressed market, the open gap is a reminder that the price has moved so far that the old close is simply out of reach in the near term. That\u2019s not a failure of the concept; it\u2019s just the concept doing its job: showing the consequences of a weekend move that never got retraced.</p>\n<p>The Feb. 6 coverage of corporate Bitcoin treasuries adds a second layer that makes the story feel bigger than chart culture. <em>CryptoSlate</em> <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/as-bitcoin-sinks-to-60k-btc-treasury-companies-go-10-billion-underwater-and-one-major-firm-is-bracing-for-a-27-billion-disaster/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">reported</a> that the slide toward $60,000 pushed corporate holders deeper underwater on paper, and it singled o", "sentiment": "negative", "categories": "regulation,macro,exchange,selloff", "coins": "BTC,ETH,LINK,MATIC,NEAR,TRX"}}

The transaction <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/crypto-boss-kulechov-buys-discounted-22-million-london-mansion\">stood</a> out against a cooling luxury housing market, which has been weighed down by higher stamp duties and policy changes introduced under the Labour government, including the rollback of tax advantages for wealthy foreign residents.</p>\n<p>Data from property research firm LonRes revealed that sales of homes priced above \u00a35 million slowed significantly toward the end of last year.

The company&#8217;s total cost basis for these holdings is $54.26 billion, which translates to an average cost of $76,052 per bitcoin.</p>\n<p>With Bitcoin dropping to almost $60,000, well below Strategy&#8217;s average purchase price, the firm&#8217;s vast BTC treasury is currently underwater.</p>\n<h2>Treasury Under Strain</h2>\n<p>In 2025, Strategy <a href=\"https://www.strategy.com/press/strategy-announces-fourth-quarter-2025-financial-results_02-05-2026\">achieved</a> a full-year BTC yield of 22.8% and recorded gains of 101,873 BTC. The company continued to expand its BTC treasury in January 2026 and ended up acquiring an additional 41,002 BTC.</p>\n<p>Strategy started in 1989 as a traditional software company focused on data analytics. In 2020, co-founder Michael Saylor made a major pivot to Bitcoin, seeing it as a safer alternative to cash during pandemic-era stimulus and low interest rates. The company began using BTC as a long-term treasury asset.</p>\n<p>By 2025, it rebranded as Strategy and fully embraced its role as a BTC-first company. The pivot drew attention from regulators and index providers, who questioned whether a firm dominated by crypto should remain in major indices. MSCI suggested companies holding more than half their assets in Bitcoin might be considered non-operating. Strategy, however, argued that it actively uses Bitcoin to raise capital and drive shareholder value. Attempts to join the S&amp;P 500 in September and December 2025 also failed.</p>\n<p>Despite this, Strategy&#8217;s Bitcoin holdings have remained central to its financial structure and are closely tied to its digital credit instruments, particularly STRC, which acts as a complementary tool for risk management and capital amplification. STRC&#8217;s growth to $3.4 billion has been supported by higher liquidity and lower volatility in the crypto markets.</p>\n<p>The company raised $25.3 billion in 2025 to support its BTC treasury and preferred stock offerings, which made it the largest US equity issuer for the second consecutive year. It also maintains a $2.25 billion USD Reserve, covering over 2.5 years of preferred stock dividends and interest obligations, providing additional stability amid market swings.</p>\n<p>The recent dip in the leading crypto asset has renewed concerns about corporate BTC exposure. Popular investor Michael Burry recently <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/michael-burry-warns-bitcoin-treasury-firms-face-existential-risk-as-btc-slide-deepens/\">claimed</a> that Bitcoin&#8217;s behavior as a speculative asset, rather than a hedge, could pose significant risks for companies holding large BTC treasuries. He observed that further price declines could leave major holders, including Strategy, deeply underwater and potentially limit access to capital markets, thereby amplifying financial stress.</p>\n<h2>Losses Surge in Q4</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, Strategy&#8217;s operating losses for the quarter were found to be $17.4 billion, entirely due to unrealized losses on digital assets, compared with a $1.0 billion operating loss in Q4 2024 under the prior accounting model.</p>\n<p>Net loss for the quarter was $12.4 billion, up from $670.8 million in the same period of 2024. Cash and cash equivalents rose to $2.3 billion from $38.1 million, driven largely by the establishment of the USD Reserve.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/strategys-bitcoin-treasury-is-underwater-but-2025-results-still-impressive/\">Strategy&#8217;s Bitcoin Treasury Is Underwater But 2025 Results Still Impressive</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CryptoPotato</a>.</p>", "sentiment": "neutral", "categories": "regulation,macro,defi,pump", "coins": "BTC,ETH"}}

Being their ultimate goal to democratize access to all private equity sectors.</p>\n<p>Positioning itself at the intersection of yachting and on-chain finance, <strong>Investing Yachts</strong> is built to <strong>remove traditional barriers</strong> associated with yacht investing\u2014such as high minimum capital requirements, illiquidity, and operational complexity\u2014by offering a token-based structure intended to be tradable on markets and supported by a managed charter fleet.</p>\n<p><strong>How the model is designed to work</strong></p>\n<p>At the core of the <strong>Investing Yachts</strong> model, the $YATE ecosystem connects charter activity to tokenholder incentives through a rules-based framework:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Charter profit distribution:</strong> Up to <strong>65% of annual net charter profits</strong> is intended to be distributed to tokenholders who lock $YATE into protocol \u201cvaults,\u201d with different lock periods associated with different maximum shares of the profit pool.</li>\n<li><strong>Buyback &amp; burn:</strong> A defined portion of net profits, <strong>10%,</strong> is earmarked for buying back tokens and burning them, aiming to reduce circulating supply over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Asset-tied issuance:</strong> New tokens are being minted in connection with acquiring additional yachts or other real-world assets, using a NAV-based issuance framework designed to align token supply with the underlying asset base and charter activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>$YATE Token Pre-Sale</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Investing Yachts</strong> states that the <strong>$YATE pre-sale is scheduled to open on February 25, 2026</strong>, with the goal of expanding community participation ahead of broader exchange availability.</p>\n<p>As described on the website and in the whitepaper documentation, the pre-sale pricing is structured as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Initial price:</strong> <strong>0.10 USDT</strong> per $YATE</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic increase:</strong> +0.75% price increase every 24 hours</li>\n<li><strong>Duration:</strong> 9 months</li>\n<li><strong>Target post\u2013pre-sale listing price:</strong> <strong>1.00 USDT</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The documentation also outlines vesting terms for pre-sale tokens, as well as other mechanisms aligned to provide sustainable growth stability for the project, rewarding long-term holders and early adopters.</p>\n<p><strong>Broker Network and Market Positioning</strong></p>\n<p>The global yacht charter and yachting services market represents a <strong>multi-billion-dollar industry</strong>, traditionally limited to a small group of high-capital participants. <strong>Investing Yachts aims to use its RWA structure to broaden access by enabling community participation through $YATE</strong>, bringing a token-based framework to a segment that has historically remained offline and illiquid.</p>\n<p><strong>Investing Yachts</strong> has established <strong>relationships with experienced yacht brokers</strong> and industry intermediaries to support fleet sourcing and charter deployment. These connections are intended to strengthen the project\u2019s ability to identify acquisition opportunities, negotiate terms, and access vessels aligned with demand in key charter regions.</p>\n<p><strong>Community and updates</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Investing Yachts</strong> is publishing updates via social channels and encourages supporters to follow the project for pre-sale announcements, documentation updates, and roadmap progress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>X: <a href=\"https://x.com/Investingyachts\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://x.com/Investingyachts</a></li>\n<li>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/investing.yachts/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/investing.yachts/</a></li>\n<li>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/+kLdobl6TM2kzYzJk\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.me/+kLdobl6TM2kzYzJk</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>About Investing Yachts</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://investingyachts.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Investing Yachts</a> is a blockchain platform described as an RWA project focused on tokenizing exposure to luxury yacht charter economics through the $YATE token (Ethereum ERC-20).</p>\n<p>Investing Yachts lists a management team and advisory group spanning technology, yacht operations, finance, media, and international legal expertise.

However, while BTC and most other alts crashed to their lowest levels since the US presidential elections in late 2024, ADA went even further, dropping to $0.222 (on Bitstamp and other exchanges) for the first time since June 2023.</p>\n<p>Despite recovering slightly to $0.27, the token is still 34% down monthly. Moreover, it has plunged by 80% since its cycle top at $1.33 marked in late 2024. Consequently, we asked ChatGPT and Gemini whether the worst is behind ADA or if there is more pain around the corner.</p>\n<h2>ChatGPT Says&#8230;</h2>\n<p>ChatGPT began with some harsh words for Cardano investors, suggesting that the decline to the $0.22 area is &#8220;not just another routine dip.&#8221; Instead, it believes it represents a &#8220;structural breakdown of long-term support, confirming that sellers remain firmly in control.&#8221; This was proven after the asset plunged below key support levels at $0.40, $0.30, and even $0.25 (which was later reclaimed, though).</p>\n<p>What could spell further trouble for ADA looking ahead is that these consecutive price drops suggest that &#8220;the buy-the-dip demand has steadily weakened&#8221; lately. As such, all eyes have now turned to the $0.20 support, which has become the &#8220;line in the sand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If ADA is to fall below that psychological level, the most realistic target during the ongoing bear phase would be a dip to $0.15-$0.16. However, ChatGPT outlined a more extreme capitulation scenario, in which the token plummets to $0.10-$0.12.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;While this may sound shocking, large-cap altcoins have historically lost 80-90% from cycle highs during severe downturns. ADA is not immune to that pattern,&#8221; it concluded.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Gemini&#8217;s Take</h2>\n<p>Dumping below $0.30 meant that ADA&#8217;s daily chart has turned into a &#8220;falling knife,&#8221; said Gemini. This breakdown below the multi-year support was the &#8220;final nail in the coffin for many long-term holders.&#8221; On its way down, the asset dumped below its 200-day MA (at around $0.45), and it obliterated millions in leveraged longs.\u00a0Gemini&#8217;s &#8220;nightmare&#8221; scenario envisions a drop to even below $0.10 if certain factors align in an adverse manner:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If Bitcoin capitulates to $55K in the coming weeks, ADA risks losing its status as a &#8220;major&#8221; altcoin. A breakdown below $0.15 opens a liquidity vacuum all the way down to $0.09. While this sounds impossible, remember that &#8220;impossible&#8221; things happen regularly in crypto winters,&#8221; it warned.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/falling-knife-gemini-and-chatgpt-predict-shocking-lows-for-cardanos-ada/\">&#8216;Falling Knife&#8217;: Gemini and ChatGPT Predict Shocking Lows for Cardano&#8217;s ADA</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CryptoPotato</a>.</p>", "sentiment": "negative", "categories": "regulation,selloff", "coins": "BTC,ETH,ADA"}}

We asked ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, and Gemini about their view on the matter.</p>\n<h2>How Low, XRP?</h2>\n<p>ChatGPT admitted that plummeting from $2.40 to $1.10 in the span of just a month means it&#8217;s not just a &#8220;healthy correction&#8221; any longer &#8211; it&#8217;s a clear shift in market structure. The rejection at $2.40 marked a decisive local top, while the subsequent breakdown below $1.50 and $1.30 erased multiple layers of support. The current weak rebound suggests that buyers remain cautious and any upside attempts are likely to face heavy selling pressure, it added.</p>\n<p>If this bearish behavior continues in the following weeks or months, the AI solution from OpenAI noted that XRP could plunge to somewhere between $0.85-$0.95. Interestingly, Perplexity sort of agreed with that target:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This range represents a realistic bear-cycle low target if broader capitulation unfolds. A move here would align with historical behavior seen across larger-cap altcoins during prolonged downturns,&#8221; Perplexity added.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gemini outlined the significance of the psychological $1.00 support. If it falls, XRP&#8217;s situation could worsen exponentially as investors will likely flock once that floor gives in. Consequently, it warned that the asset&#8217;s crash might take it even further south, to a low of somewhere around $0.60. Interestingly, that would result in completing a full circle since the US presidential elections in 2024, as XRP started its ascent from those levels.</p>\n<h2>Chances for a Rebound?</h2>\n<p>All AIs noted that it&#8217;s difficult to be optimistic in the current market environment. However, Grok outlined a possible bounce-off scenario in case XRP has already bottomed at $1.10.</p>\n<p>The AI integrated into X said the cross-border token can remain sideways between $1.10 and $1.45 for the next few weeks and possibly look ahead for a more decisive rebound to over $1.60 if it manages to take down the $1.50 resistance. This would be the so-called &#8216;bull case&#8217; in which XRP doesn&#8217;t break down beneath $1.00 soon. If it does, all bets are off, Grok added, and warned of further declines to under $0.90.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/we-asked-4-ais-how-low-xrp-could-fall-this-bear-cycle-the-answers-were-shocking/\">We Asked 4 AIs How Low XRP Could Fall This Bear Cycle &#8211; The Answers Were Shocking</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CryptoPotato</a>.</p>", "sentiment": "negative", "categories": "selloff", "coins": "ETH,SOL,XRP"}}

While bitcoin has become more embedded in institutional portfolios, Waller suggested that price swings remain part of the market\u2019s character rather than a systemic concern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUps and downs in the crypto world have become so common they actually have a name for them: winters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the game.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waller dismissed recent declines in bitcoin\u2019s price as less dramatic when viewed through a longer lens, noting that levels once considered extraordinary are now treated as routine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPeople like, oh my god, bitcoin\u2019s down to 63,000,\u201d he said. \u201cEight years ago, if you just said it was 10,000 you would have said, oh my god, this is crazy.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">JUST IN: <img alt=\"\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller says Bitcoin volatility is just &quot;a part of the game.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It's happened before.

In his view, crypto remains a separate ecosystem that can experience sharp crashes without triggering spillovers into traditional finance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThese things are pretty detached from the traditional finance world,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have these big crashes and move volume. The rest of us wake up and we\u2019re fine the next day. Nothing bad&#8217;s going on. The banks are open. Your payments are being made.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waller said he does not closely monitor crypto markets as part of his day-to-day responsibilities at the central bank, describing the sector as still outside the core of the financial system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe banks are open. Your payments are being made,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early on in his talk, Waller compared a typical blockchain transaction to buying an apple at the grocery store, with different objects and different rails but the same basic structure of payment, execution, and recordkeeping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn the decentralized crypto world, a crypto asset, or digital asset, is the object that people want to buy,\u201d Waller said, pointing to bitcoin and other tokens. The transaction, he argued, relies on new technologies such as blockchains, tokenization, and smart contracts, which he described as tools rather than threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThose are just technologies,\u201d Waller said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing dangerous about them. There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Waller: Bitcoin and crypto are becoming more commonplace</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, Waller acknowledged that crypto markets have begun to intersect more with mainstream finance, particularly as traditional firms explore blockchain-based infrastructure. He pointed to efforts by financial institutions and even the U.S. Treasury to <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">consider</a> tokenized securities trading that could operate around the clock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability to support 24/7 global trading, he said, represents one of the key innovations of blockchain-based systems compared with legacy banking infrastructure built around business hours and slower clearing cycles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThese technologies were built to do this globally, 24 by seven from the beginning,\u201d Waller said. \u201cThey\u2019re not legacy systems.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He argued that this constant trading and settlement capability is already forcing traditional financial institutions to improve their own payment systems, especially in cross-border transfers where crypto rails can move value without relying on established networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re forcing the big banks, everybody else, to sort of make their payments, especially cross border, faster and cheaper,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waller also highlighted the need for clearer regulatory definitions around digital assets, including whether various tokens should be treated as securities or commodities. He said that responsibility lies with Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe bigger problem is clarity,\u201d Waller said, adding that progress in Congress appears stalled. \u201cEverybody thought clarity would come in that would clear the road,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going anywhere anytime soon.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waller suggested that some of the recent cooling in crypto market enthusiasm reflects fading expectations that sweeping legislation would arrive quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe lack of passing of the clarity act has kind of put people off,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Waller emphasized that bitcoin and speculative crypto assets are not his focus as a central banker, he offered blunt advice to investors navigating the sector\u2019s volatility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPrices go up. Prices go down,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t get in.\u201d</p>\n<p>This post <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/feds-waller-shrugs-off-bitcoin-volatility\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fed\u2019s Waller Shrugs Off Bitcoin Volatility, Says Crypto Crashes Don\u2019t Threaten Banks</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bitcoin Magazine</a> and is written by <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/micahzimmerman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Micah Zimmerman</a>.</p>", "sentiment": "negative", "categories": "etf,regulation,macro,institutional,defi,selloff", "coins": "BTC,ETH,MATIC"}}

The bitcoin price just melted all the way through the $70,000s and $60,000s last week, but finally found its footing at $60,000. The bulls battled back from down there to push the price back up to $71,700 before it moved back slightly to close the week out at $70,315. The bears covered a lot of ground to the downside last week, so the bulls will try to get back some ground this week. Expect $60,000 support to hold at least into this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Bitcoin Rebounds from $60K Capitulation Low, Eyes $74,500 Resistance This Week\" class=\"wp-image-50376\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-3-1024x730.png\" title=\"Bitcoin Rebounds from $60K Capitulation Low, Eyes $74,500 Resistance This Week 1\" width=\"1024\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong><strong>Key Support and Resistance Levels Now</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With such a big move down last Thursday, we will need to find new resistance levels to watch going forward. Over the short term, $71,800 is a level to watch after the price rejected there Friday into Saturday. Above here, we have the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement from the latest move down, sitting at $74,500. If the price can manage to climb above this level, $79,000 should be a strong resistance. $84,000 sits firmly above this level and should be very strong resistance going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking below, the bulls will look to hold $65,650 in order to try to put in the reversal here. $63,000 sits just below here as support. Next, we have $60,000 as newfound support just above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement at $57,800. Arguably, the true support sits at $57,800 here and was slightly front-run at that $60,000 low. If this level is lost, we will look all the way down to $44,000 for support, then $39,000 at the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement below here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Outlook For This Week</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MRI Indicator gave us a buy signal on Friday last week on the daily chart off of the $60,000 low. The move was strong from that level, so the bulls will have to try to capitalize on this bounce to continue the momentum into this week. This signal can produce a full reversal, but often only results in a 1 to 4 candle correction of the trend. So if the bulls can keep the push higher going into Wednesday, we may be looking at a sustainable reversal on the daily chart, which could attempt to reclaim the $80,000 level.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Bitcoin Rebounds from $60K Capitulation Low, Eyes $74,500 Resistance This Week\" class=\"wp-image-50377\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-4-1024x730.png\" title=\"Bitcoin Rebounds from $60K Capitulation Low, Eyes $74,500 Resistance This Week 2\" width=\"1024\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong><strong>Market mood: </strong>Bearish \u2013 The price lost a lot of ground last week. The bears are in control. Period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The next few weeks<br /> </strong>The bears took the price down another big leg last week. Weekly RSI hit oversold levels and produced a big bounce. After such a significant drop and such a big bounce back from $60,000, the price should remain constrained within a range here for at least the next few weeks. Do not expect to see any price action above $80,000 or below $60,000 for the next few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-50378\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-5-1024x730.png\" title=\"Bitcoin Rebounds from $60K Capitulation Low, Eyes $74,500 Resistance This Week 3\" width=\"1024\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong></strong><strong>Terminology Guide:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bulls/Bullish: </strong>Buyers or investors expecting the price to go higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bears/Bearish: </strong>Sellers or investors expecting the price to go lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Support or support level: </strong>A level at which the price should hold for the asset, at least initially. The more touches on support, the weaker it gets and the more likely it is to fail to hold the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Resistance or resistance level: </strong>Opposite of support.&nbsp; The level that is likely to reject the price, at least initially. The more touches at resistance, the weaker it gets and the more likely it is to fail to hold back the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Oscillators:</strong> Technical indicators that vary over time, but typically remain within a band between set levels. Thus, they oscillate between a low level (typically representing oversold conditions) and a high level (typically representing overbought conditions). E.G., Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RSI Oscillator:</strong> The Relative Strength Index is a momentum oscillator that moves between 0 and 100. It measures the speed of the price and changes in the speed of the price movements. When RSI is over 70, it is considered to be overbought. When RSI is below 30, it is considered to be oversold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fibonacci Retracements and Extensions: </strong>Ratios based on what is known as the golden ratio, a universal ratio pertaining to growth and decay cycles in nature. The golden ratio is based on the constants Phi (1.618) and phi (0.618).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Momentum Reversal Indicator (MRI):</strong> A proprietary indicator created by Tone Vays. The MRI indicator tracks buyer and seller momentum and exhaustion, providing signals to indicate when to expect momentum to fade and accelerate.</p>\n<p>This post <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-rebounds-from-60k-capitulation-low-eyes-74500-resistance-this-week\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bitcoin Rebounds from $60K Capitulation Low, Eyes $74,500 Resistance This Week</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bitcoin Magazine</a> and is written by <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/juan-galt?mab_v3=50373\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ethan Greene - Feral Analysis&nbsp;and&nbsp;Juan Galt</a>.</p>", "sentiment": "negative", "categories": "general", "coins": "BTC,ETH,SOL,TRX"}}

Shares of CIFR rose roughly 134% to $16.50 on Monday, while WULF climbed 13% to $16.20.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marathon shares increased slightly to $8.28, below its $8 target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morgan Stanley\u2019s thesis focuses on the transformation of bitcoin mining sites into data center assets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Byrd <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/09/cipher-mining-and-terawulf-are-buys-mara-a-sell-as-morgan-stanley-begins-bitcoin-miner-coverag\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">argued</a> that once a miner has built a data center and signed a long-term lease with a creditworthy counterparty, the asset should be valued for stable, long-term cash flow rather than bitcoin exposure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He likened these sites to data center real estate investment trusts (REITs) such as Equinix (EQIX) and Digital Realty (DLR), which trade at high multiples due to scale and predictable revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cipher Mining sits at the <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/iren-cipher-cifr-mining-stock-soar\">center of that framework</a>. Byrd described its facilities as suited to what he called a \u201cREIT endgame,\u201d where leased data centers function like toll roads, generating predictable cash flows with minimal reliance on bitcoin\u2019s price.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TeraWulf also fits the model, with a track record of signing data center agreements and management experience in power infrastructure. The firm plans to expand 250 megawatts of data center capacity per year through 2032, with Morgan Stanley modeling success rates of 50% in a base case and 75% in an optimistic scenario.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marathon Digital received a more cautious assessment.

Total value locked across major protocols climbed into the tens of billions of dollars and, at previous peaks, surpassed $100 billion.</p>\n<p>Ripple\u2019s pitch is that the next phase will be shaped less by permissionless pools and more by controlled access, compliant settlement, and tokenized cash and collateral that institutions can recognize as market infrastructure.</p>\n<p>In a February <a href=\"https://ripple.com/insights/institutional-defi-on-xrpl-scaling-real-world-finance-with-xrp-at-the-core/\">blueprint</a>, Ripple described an institutional DeFi stack on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) that centers on stablecoin settlement, tokenized collateral, compliance controls, and an on-ledger credit layer, which is planned for later this year.</p>\n<p>Rather than competing with the largest DeFi hubs on raw totals, Ripple is emphasizing primitives that align with how institutions already organize markets, including identity, access control, cash flows, and collateral settlement.</p>\n<h2>Cash and collateral are scaling</h2>\n<p>A key part of Ripple\u2019s framing is that the most durable activity may sit outside traditional DeFi totals. Tokenized cash equivalents and high-grade collateral have expanded sufficiently to continue attracting attention even as speculative activity cools.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.rwa.xyz/\">RWA.xyz</a>, which tracks tokenized real-world assets, reported a represented asset value of about $21.41 billion and a distributed asset value of nearly $23.87 billion. Its tokenized US Treasuries dashboard showed a total value of around $10.0 billion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/xrp-is-thriving-everywhere-except-on-its-own-chain/\">Ripple is positioning XRPL</a> to align more closely with those flows. The blueprint highlighted features to support tokenized instruments and delivery-versus-payment workflows, while keeping access controls and compliance tooling close to the base layer.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the extent to which large tokenization remains contested.</p>\n<p>McKinsey has <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/povilasrandis_mckinsey-report-tt-outlook-2025-activity-7359492125295599617-YJXk\">estimated</a> that tokenized market capitalization across asset classes could reach about $2 trillion by 2030.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a separate BCG and ADDX <a href=\"https://addx.co/insights/bcg-addx-report-asset-tokenization-to-grow-50x-into-us-16-trillion-opportunity-by-2030/\">report</a> forecast a larger opportunity, projecting that tokenization could reach about $16.1 trillion by 2030.</p>\n<h2>What is live on XRPL, and what is still on the roadmap</h2>\n<p>Ripple\u2019s institutional argument hinges on a clear split between what the network can already support and what still has to ship.</p>\n<p>The XRPL already runs meaningful transaction volume and has native exchange rails.</p>\n<p>Messari <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-xrp-ledger-q4-2025\">said</a> average daily transactions rose 3.1% quarter over quarter to about 1.83 million in the fourth quarter of 2025, while average daily active addresses slipped to about 49,000.</p>\n<p>Payment transactions declined 8.1% to roughly 909,000, while offer creation grew to about 42% of the transaction mix.</p>\n<p>Those figures do not, on their own, show institutional participation. But they matter to Ripple\u2019s pitch because they indicate that the settlement and exchange layer is already used at scale, which reduces the burden on institutions to treat XRPL as an operating rail rather than a greenfield experiment.</p>\n<p>Ripple said several components are already live, including Multi-Purpose Tokens, a token standard designed to carry metadata such as restrictions, and Credentials, which it describes as an identity layer for attaching attestations such as KYC status to participants.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/xrpl-permissioned-domains-make-regulated-defi-more-real-and-the-first-battleground-will-likely-be-stablecoin-order-books/\">Ripple also listed Permissioned Domains,</a> along with tooling such as Simulate and Deep Freeze, and an <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/xrp-ledger-launches-evm-sidechain-bridging-ethereum-and-xrp/\">XRPL EVM sidechain</a>.</p>\n<p>It also laid out a timetable for additional pieces, including a permissioned decentralized exchange in the second quarter, smart escrows and Multi-Purpose Token DEX integration in the second quarter, and confidential transfers for Multi-Purpose Tokens using zero-knowledge proofs in the first quarter.</p>\n<p>The roadmap also includes a lending protocol based on the XLS-65 and XLS-66 specifications.</p>\n<p>The near-term reporting test is whether measurable liquidity deepens before the later features arrive.</p>\n<p>DefiLlama data showed <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/rlusd-supply-hit-1-26b-and-82-of-it-now-sits-on-ethereum-not-xrpl/\">stablecoins circulating on XRPL</a> at roughly $418 million, with RLUSD accounting for about 83% of that total. It also showed the XRPL DEX at about $38.21 million in total value locked and about $15.08 million in 24-hour volume, with cumulative volume around $2.019 billion.</p>\n<p>Those baselines are not large relative to the biggest DeFi venues, but they provide a concrete starting point for evaluating whether permissioned markets deepen, whether order books thicken, and whether routed volume rises once the roadmap items ship.</p>\n<h2>Why XRP matters in the plumbing</h2>\n<p>Ripple\u2019s claim is that XRP\u2019s relevance comes less from a burn narrative and more from how the ledger routes value.</p>\n<p>On XRPL, transaction fees are paid in XRP and destroyed, a design meant to deter spam. The network\u2019s base transaction cost is small, often described as 10 drops, and the protocol burns the exact fee specified when a transaction is included in a validated ledger.</p>\n<p>For context, Messari quantified the fee channel's actual size. It said transaction fees, in dollars, fell to about $133,100 in the fourth quarter, and that native transaction fees declined to about 57,600 XRP.</p>\n<p>It also said roughly 14.3 million XRP had been burned since the ledger\u2019s inception, a low burn rate it tied to low per-transaction costs.</p>\n<p>XRPL also uses reserves that can create structural demand for XRP as usage grows. Official XRPL documentation lists a base reserve of 1 XRP per account and an owner reserve of 0.2 XRP per item, which applies to objects such as trust lines and offers.</p>\n<p>That said, Ripple\u2019s argument implies that fee burn and reserves are not the primary levers. The larger story is liquidity routing.</p>\n<p>XRPL\u2019s decentralized exchange supports auto-bridging, which can use XRP as an intermediary when it reduces costs compared with trading two tokens directly.</p>\n<p>This is where the institutional pitch becomes testable. If regulated stablecoin and FX pairs develop on a permissioned DEX, XRP could become inventory held by market makers to intermediate flows.</p>\n<p>But the design does not guarantee that outcome. Auto-bridging is conditional, and direct stablecoin-to-stablecoin pairs can dominate if they offer better execution.</p>\n<p>Ripple\u2019s thesis rests on XRP becoming the preferred hop often enough that it functions as market-structure plumbing rather than a passive fee token.</p>\n<h2>The stablecoin wedge and the credit question</h2>\n<p>Ripple is leaning on stablecoins as the institutional on-ramp and forecasts diverge on how fast that market could grow.</p>\n<p>JPMorgan analysts project that stablecoins could reach $500 billion by 2028, calling higher projections too optimistic.

Data from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange show Chinese lenders\u2019 holdings of dollar-denominated bonds at roughly $298 billion as of September.</p>\n<p>However, a critical unknown and the source of market jitters is exactly how much of that figure is allocated specifically to Treasuries versus other dollar debt.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, this regulatory pressure on commercial lenders isn't happening in a vacuum. It compounds a year-long strategic retreat from US treasuries, already evident in Beijing's official accounts.</p>\n<p>The US Treasury\u2019s \u201cMajor Foreign Holders\u201d <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/foreign-treasury-holdings-china\">data</a> show that mainland China\u2019s official Treasury holdings fell to $682.6 billion in November 2025, the lowest level in the past decade.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_518954\" style=\"width: 1000px;\"><img alt=\"US Treasuries Held by China\" class=\"size-full wp-image-518954\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-09-150219.jpg\" width=\"1000\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-518954\">US Treasuries Held by China (Source: Trading Economy)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This continues a trend that has accelerated over the past five years, as <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/why-chinas-record-gold-bet-validates-bitcoin/\">China has aggressively reduced its dependence on the US financial market.</a></p>\n<p>Essentially, the combined picture is stark: the bid from the East is drying up across both commercial and state channels.</p>\n<p>For Bitcoin, the threat isn\u2019t that China will single-handedly \u201cbreak\u201d the Treasury market. The US market is simply too deep for that; with $28.86 trillion in marketable debt, China\u2019s $682.6 billion represents just 2.4% of the stock.</p>\n<p>However, the real danger is more subtle: if reduced foreign participation forces US yields higher via the term premium, it will tighten the very financial conditions that high-volatility assets like crypto depend on.</p>\n<h2>The \u201cterm premium\u201d channel is where things get interesting</h2>\n<p>On the day the headlines broke, the US 10-year yield <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield\">hovered around 4.23%</a>. While that level isn't inherently a crisis, the risk lies in how it could rise.</p>\n<p>An orderly repricing is manageable, but a disorderly spike caused by a buyer strike can trigger rapid deleveraging across rates, equities, and crypto.</p>\n<p>A 2025 economic <a href=\"https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/economic-bulletin/the-changing-investor-composition-of-us-treasuries-part-1-foreign-treasury-sales-could-raise-us-yields/\">bulletin</a> from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City offers a sobering assessment of this scenario. It estimates that a one-standard-deviation liquidation among foreign investors could spike Treasury yields by 25 to 100 basis points.</p>\n<p>Crucially, it notes that yields can rise even without dramatic selling, as simply a reduced appetite for new issuance is enough to pressure rates higher.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a more extreme tail-risk benchmark comes from a 2022 NBER working <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30476/w30476.pdf\">paper</a> on stress episodes. The study estimates that an &#8220;identified&#8221; $100 billion sale by foreign officials could shock the 10-year yield by more than 100 basis points on impact before fading.</p>\n<p>This isn't a baseline forecast, but it serves as a reminder that during liquidity shocks, positioning dominates fundamentals.</p>\n<h2>Why Bitcoin cares: real yields and financial conditions</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin has traded like a macro duration asset for much of the post-2020 cycle.</p>\n<p>In that regime, higher yields and tighter liquidity often translate into weaker bids for speculative assets, even when the catalyst begins in rates rather than crypto.</p>\n<p>So, the real-yield component is vital here. With the US 10-year <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10?\">inflation-adjusted (TIPS) yield</a> at roughly 1.89% on Feb. 5, the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets is rising.</p>\n<p>However, the trap for bears is that broader financial conditions are not yet screaming \u201ccrisis.\u201d The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Financial Conditions <a href=\"https://www.chicagofed.org/research/data/nfci/current-data\">Index</a> sat at -0.56 for the week ending Jan. 30, indicating conditions remain looser than average.</p>\n<p>This nuance is dangerous: markets can tighten meaningfully from easy levels without tipping into systemic stress.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for crypto bulls, that intermediate tightening is often enough to knock Bitcoin lower without triggering a Fed rescue.</p>\n<p>Notably, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-short-term-holders-are-panic-selling-at-a-loss-but-was-this-capitulation-or-just-a-leverage-reset/\">Bitcoin\u2019s recent price action</a> confirms this sensitivity. Last week, the flagship digital asset <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-whales-are-dumping-massive-amounts-of-supply-on-exchanges-as-liquidations-mirror-the-2022-ftx-market-collapse/\">briefly fell below $60,000</a> amid broad risk-off moves, only to rebound above $70,000 as markets stabilized.</p>\n<p>By Feb. 9, Bitcoin is bouncing again, proving it remains a high-beta gauge of global liquidity sentiment.</p>\n<h2>Four scenarios for traders watching the China\u2013yields\u2013BTC feedback loop</h2>\n<p>To understand what comes next, traders are not just looking at whether China sells, but also how the market absorbs those sales. The impact on Bitcoin depends entirely on the speed of the move and the resulting stress on dollar liquidity.</p>\n<p>Here are the four key ways this dynamic is likely to play out in the months ahead.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0<strong>\u201cContained de-risking\u201d (base case):</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this case, banks slow their incremental buying, and China\u2019s headline holdings drift lower, mostly through maturities and reallocation rather than urgent selling.</p>\n<p>As a result, US yields grind higher by 10 to 30 basis points over time, largely through term premium and the market\u2019s need to absorb supply.</p>\n<p>Here, Bitcoin faces a mild headwind, but the dominant drivers remain US macro data and shifting expectations for the Federal Reserve.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>\u201cTerm premium reprices\u201d (bearish macro regime): </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the market interprets China\u2019s guidance as a secular shift in foreign appetite, yields could reprice into the Kansas City Fed\u2019s 25\u2013100 basis point range.</p>\n<p>A move like that, especially if real yields lead, would likely tighten financial conditions enough to compress risk exposure and push crypto lower through higher funding costs, reduced liquidity, and risk-parity-style deleveraging.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>\u201cDisorderly liquidity shock\u201d (tail risk): </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A fast, politicized, or crowded exit, even if not led by China, can create outsized price effects.</p>\n<p>The stress-episode framework linking a $100 billion foreign-official sale to a more than 100-basis-point move on impact is the kind of reference traders cite when considering nonlinear outcomes.</p>\n<p>In this scenario,", "sentiment": "negative", "categories": "regulation,macro,defi,whale,selloff", "coins": "BTC,ETH,LINK,MATIC,NEAR,MKR,TRX"}}

It\u2019s a clean narrative, and it\u2019s not wrong, but it\u2019s incomplete, because Bitcoin is not just a ticker. The network has its own internal plumbing, and some of the best clues about where we are in the cycle are sitting in plain sight on-chain.</p>\n<p>The charts I\u2019ve been watching feel a bit like checking the pulse under the headline. Miners, long-term holders, and the broad mass of wallets don\u2019t react the way ETFs do, they don\u2019t flip direction on a whim, they grind, they hold, then they crack, then they recover.</p>\n<p>That is why I decided to check in on a few cycle gauges that have kept me honest across the years, miner reserves, NUPL, and the percentage of UTXOs in profit.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoin miner reserves dwindle</h2>\n<p>We'll start with miners, because miners are where the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> \u201creal economy\u201d meets the fiat world. They have bills to pay, they are constantly converting electricity into BTC, and when the math stops working they don\u2019t get to be philosophical about it, they sell, they shut down, they restructure, they move, they hedge, they survive.</p>\n<p>In the data here, miner reserves are sliding to levels we haven\u2019t seen since the early era. Miners currently hold about 1.801 million BTC.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_518918\" style=\"width: 1024px;\"><img alt=\"Bitcoin miner reserves have steadily declined from their early-cycle peak, even as price trends higher over the long term, underscoring a structural drawdown in miner-held supply.

Some of that is price, some of that is coins leaving miner wallets, and the combination is what matters, because it tightens their margin of safety.</p>\n<p>If BTC is falling while reserves are thinning, miners have less cushion to ride out volatility, and the market has one more source of potential supply if things get ugly.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_518920\" style=\"width: 1024px;\"><img alt=\"Bitcoin miner reserves measured in USD have dropped sharply alongside recent price weakness, erasing a significant portion of the sector\u2019s balance-sheet buffer despite remaining elevated by historical standards.

(Source: CryptoQuant)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This is where the ETF narrative collides with the on-chain narrative. The ETF tape can be brutal, and it can overwhelm everything else in the short run.</p>\n<p>Looking at recent flow data, the net move over roughly the last 10 trading days shown is about negative $1.7 billion, around $170 million per day on average. That number matters because it\u2019s big enough to dominate marginal demand, and it\u2019s fast enough to change sentiment before most people even register the shift.</p>\n<p>But the problem with staring at flows alone is that it tells you what\u2019s happening at the surface, not what\u2019s building underneath.</p>\n<h2>Net unrealized profit and loss chart</h2>\n<p>If I\u2019m trying to work out where we are in the cycle, I want to know whether the market is in a normal downturn that can snap back, or whether it\u2019s approaching a deeper reset that needs a real washout.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I keep one eye on NUPL, net unrealized profit and loss. It\u2019s not perfect, nothing is, but it does a good job of showing when the market as a whole is sitting on profit, sitting on pain, or sitting somewhere in between.</p>\n<p>In the latest data, NUPL is still positive, around 0.215, which keeps Bitcoin in the green zone. It has fallen hard over the last couple of months, down about 0.17, and that slope is the part that grabs me, because you can feel the mood shifting in that compression.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_518917\" style=\"width: 1024px;\"><img alt=\"Bitcoin\u2019s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) remains positive but has compressed sharply, signaling declining aggregate profitability without a full capitulation into net losses.

(Source: CryptoQuant)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The line in the sand for me is when NUPL goes below zero, and especially if it pushes toward negative 0.2.</p>\n<p>NUPL last dipped below zero in early 2023, and the last time it was below negative 0.2 was late 2022. That\u2019s the territory where true capitulation lives, that\u2019s where the \u201cbear bottom confirmation\u201d argument has usually been strongest.</p>\n<p>We aren\u2019t there right now, and that matters if you\u2019re trying to call a bottom today. It doesn\u2019t mean we cannot be close, it does mean we don\u2019t yet have the kind of confirmation that usually comes with a classic cycle low.</p>\n<h2>How many trades are in profit right now?</h2>\n<p>Then there\u2019s the UTXOs in profit chart, and this one is quietly fascinating because it shows how the market has matured over time. At the bottoms in earlier cycles, almost nobody was in profit.</p>\n<p>In 2011 the trough was around 8 percent, in 2015 around 15 percent, in 2018 around 49 percent. The COVID crash in 2020 is a weird outlier that I tend to treat as its own event.</p>\n<p>In 2023, the trough was about 60 percent. In the current data, 2026 has already printed a low around 58 percent, and the latest reading is around 71 percent.</p>\n<p>That pattern, those rising floor levels, tells a human story.

In December as well, another one ended up losing $50 million in a similar way.</p>\n<p>Together, the two incidents cost $62 million, according to the popular Web3 security solution, Scam Sniffer.</p>\n<h2>Crypto Blunders</h2>\n<p>Signature phishing attacks also surged in January. In fact, Scam Sniffer <a href=\"https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/2020343088523407836\">found</a> that $6.27 million was stolen from 4,741 victims, which is a 207% increase from December. The largest cases involved $3.02 million from SLVon and XAUt via permit/increaseAllowance, and $1.08 million from aEthLBTC via permit.</p>\n<p>Two wallets alone accounted for 65% of all phishing losses.</p>\n<p>Address poisoning is a scam where attackers send small transactions from wallet addresses that closely resemble real ones, hoping users copy the wrong address from their transaction history. This can lead to funds being sent directly to scammers by mistake. Signature phishing further increases the risk by tricking users into signing malicious approvals that give attackers permission to move funds later. As such, these tactics rely on social engineering and human error, and may make even experienced users vulnerable.</p>\n<p>In November last year, a crypto holder lost over $3 million worth of PYTH tokens after mistakenly sending funds to a scammer&#8217;s wallet. The error occurred when the victim copied a fake deposit address from their transaction history.</p>\n<p>Blockchain analysts at Lookonchain <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/careless-crypto-transfer-costs-investor-3-08m-details/\">said</a> the attacker created a lookalike address matching the first four characters of the real wallet and sent a tiny SOL transaction to appear legitimate. The victim later transferred 7 million PYTH tokens without fully verifying the address and fell victim to an address poisoning attack. The transferred stash was worth about $3.08 million at that time.</p>\n<h2>Coordinated Multisig Scam Attempt</h2>\n<p>Amidst the growing frequency of such attacks, the non-custodial wallet, Safe, formerly known as Gnosis Safe, also <a href=\"https://x.com/SafeLabs_/status/2019709903946879149\">issued</a> a warning for its users about a large-scale address poisoning and social engineering campaign targeting multisig wallets. According to the platform, attackers created thousands of lookalike Safe addresses to trick users into sending funds to the wrong destination. It disclosed that the incident was not a protocol exploit, infrastructure breach, or smart contract vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Safe identified around 5,000 malicious addresses, which have now been flagged and removed from the Safe Wallet interface to reduce the risk of accidental fund transfers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/how-2-wallet-errors-and-phishing-attacks-cost-crypto-users-62m/\">How 2 Wallet Errors and Phishing Attacks Cost Crypto Users $62M</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CryptoPotato</a>.</p>", "sentiment": "positive", "categories": "etf,regulation,hack,pump", "coins": "BTC,ETH,SOL"}}

Such transfers often reflect miners converting part of their holdings to cover operating costs or lock in profits during volatile conditions, making these flows a gauge of potential sell-side supply.</p>\n<p>The timing is notable, as Bitcoin experienced a steep correction last week that briefly pushed prices below $60,000 for the first time since October 2024, extending a drawdown of more than 50% from the last all-time high, according to analysis <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/69885418c876a02133a03550-Massive-BTC-inflows-signal-capitulation-across-the-crypto-market\">posted</a> by Darkfost.</p>\n<p>During that window, nearly 241,000 BTC flowed into exchanges across the market, with Binance seeing especially heavy activity from short-term holders. Darkfost described these flows as consistent with capitulation, particularly among investors reacting to rapid losses.</p>\n<p>Retail behavior also shifted, with Darkfost <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/6988ec5463d8c427644249f2-Bitcoin-drop-sparks-a-wave-of-retail-panic\">noting</a> that holders with less than 1 BTC, often referred to as \u201cshrimps,\u201d heavily increased transfers to Binance after the sell-off. On February 5, their daily inflows topped 1,000 BTC, far above the monthly average of around 365 BTC. However, that spike eased as prices stabilized, suggesting selling pressure from this group faded once Bitcoin <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/btc-price-retests-70k-as-bnb-overtakes-xrp-weekend-watch/\">recovered</a> above $70,000.</p>\n<h2>Whales Accumulate as Price Steadies Near $70,000</h2>\n<p>While miners and smaller holders sent coins to exchanges, large holders took the opposite approach.

The rebound followed a sharp fall from the mid-$80,000 range, part of a broader slide that <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-erases-post-trump-election-gains-altcoins-crash-by-double-digits-your-weekly-crypto-recap/\">erased</a> gains made after the U.S. election and dragged major altcoins down by double digits.</p>\n<p>Sentiment remains fragile, a state highlighted by the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, which <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-fear-and-greed-index-plummets-to-6-year-low-is-the-worst-over/\">fell</a> to its lowest reading since 2019, even after prices bounced from the lows.

However, when asked to choose one asset, he would go for bitcoin. This is because gold is infinite in theory, while BTC is finite by design.</p>\n<p>As the value of metal rises, more gold miners will dig for more, and this could increase the amount of the bullion in circulation. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is designed to have a limit of 21 million units.</p>\n<p>The asset has a current circulating supply of 19.98 million, less than 2 million BTC away from reaching the limit. This means no more BTC can be added to circulation after the network mines 21 million units, ensuring long-term scarcity. Kiyosaki called this a brilliant strategy that could propel the value of BTC upwards.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cGlad I bought my Bitcoin early. I am still actively mining for gold and drilling for oil,\u201d the author added.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Can Kiyosaki\u2019s Words Be Trusted?</h2>\n<p>Although Kiyosaki\u2019s latest tweet aligns with his Bitcoin advocacy, the author has made several contradictory statements over the past few months. Just last week, CryptoPotato <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/robert-kiyosaki-faces-backlash-over-contradictory-bitcoin-buying-claims/\">reported</a> that he faced backlash for making inconsistent statements about buying bitcoin.</p>\n<p>Kiyosaki has made several posts claiming he was buying BTC, even as the asset\u2019s value surged above $105,000 in mid-2025. However, a few weeks ago, he revealed that he stopped buying BTC at $6,000. The last time BTC traded at this price was in mid-2020, after the COVID-19 market crash.</p>\n<p>On a separate occasion, the investor <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/kiyosaki-on-btcs-crash-why-hes-not-selling-now-and-when-hell-buy-more/\">stated</a> that he will not sell his bitcoin, even amid market crashes, but will continue to buy. He made the tweet on November 15, 2025, and a week later, he had <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/robert-kiyosaki-cashes-out-bitcoin-whats-behind-his-surprising-decision/\">sold</a> the stash he bought at $6,000 for a total of $2.25 million. The serial entrepreneur said he would use the proceeds to buy two surgery centers and invest in a billboard business to increase his cash flow.</p>\n<p>Despite revealing that he sold his Bitcoin holdings in November, Kiyosaki said in his latest tweet about choosing BTC over gold that he is glad he bought his bitcoins early. This raises questions about which BTC stash he is talking about.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-bitcoin-is-a-better-investment-than-gold-heres-why/\">Robert Kiyosaki Says Bitcoin Is a Better Investment Than Gold \u2013 Here\u2019s Why</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CryptoPotato</a>.</p>", "sentiment": "positive", "categories": "mining,selloff,pump", "coins": "BTC,SOL"}}

That is the highest reading since August 2025 and came as ETH corrected sharply from the $3,000 area to the low $2,000s.</p>\n<p>The divergence between falling prices and rising network activity is often associated with panic-driven behavior, where holders rush to move assets during fast drawdowns.</p>\n<p>CryptoOnchain linked the spike to investors rotating into stablecoins, moving funds onto exchanges for sale, and a wave of liquidations across decentralized finance protocols as collateral values fell.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThis significant spike in ERC-20 token transfers during a price crash suggests investors are rushing to exit positions, likely converting volatile assets into stablecoins or moving funds to exchanges for liquidation,\u201d the market observer wrote.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The timing also lines up with a broader market sell-off that saw Bitcoin fall from above $80,000 to near $60,000 before rebounding toward $72,000, while Ethereum struggled to hold key support near $2,000.</p>\n<p>Selling pressure has not been limited to smaller holders, with the likes of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/vitalik-buterin-increases-eth-selling-as-price-falls-below-2k/\">selling</a> more than 6,100 ETH over several days last week. Other large holders also reduced exposure to repay loans, adding to short-term pressure during the drop.</p>\n<h2>Exchange Balances Fall Even as Volatility Stays High</h2>\n<p>Despite the recent rush of token movement, several indicators have also pointed to declining ETH availability on exchanges. According to on-chain detective CoinNiel, Ethereum held on exchanges has <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/698904d2312550148f4eae5c-Ethereum-Exchange-Balances-Return-to-2016-Levels\">fallen</a> to levels last seen in mid-2016. Experts from the Arab Chain platform also added that Binance\u2019s ETH reserves have <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/69889dd5c876a02133a03602-Ethereum-Reserves-on-Binance-Drop-to-Their-Lowest-Levels-Since-2024\">dropped</a> to about 3.7 million ETH, the lowest since 2024.</p>\n<p>The situation has created a mixed picture. On one hand, ETH\u2019s price action remains weak, with the asset currently trading around $2,040, down about 3% over the past 24 hours and nearly 11% in the last seven days. The token briefly dipped below $1,900 on February 5, per data from CoinGecko, before <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-reclaims-2k-level-bitcoin-recovery-halted-at-72k-weekend-watch/\">recovering</a> to its current level.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, falling exchange balances suggest fewer coins are readily available for spot selling, and some of the recent transfers may reflect stress-driven repositioning rather than long-term distribution. According to CryptoOnchain, similar spikes in transfer activity during past drawdowns have sometimes occurred near local lows, once forced selling eased.</p>\n<p>For now, Ethereum sits between ongoing volatility and shrinking exchange supply, with on-chain data showing fear-driven movement even as longer-term holders continue pulling coins off trading platforms.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/panic-selling-grips-ethereum-eth-movements-hit-peak-levels-since-last-august/\">Panic Selling Grips Ethereum: ETH Movements Hit Peak Levels Since Last August</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CryptoPotato</a>.</p>", "sentiment": "neutral", "categories": "exchange,whale,selloff,pump", "coins": "BTC,ETH,LINK,NEAR"}}

The volume of verified wagers underscores the platform\u2019s ongoing focus on transparency, statistical fairness, and game integrity.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2020, <a href=\"https://crypto.games/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CryptoGames</a> was built around a clear guiding principle: to offer a gambling environment where fairness can be independently verified, odds are fully understood, and competition takes place on equal terms. Rather than relying on large libraries of third-party games with opaque mechanics, CryptoGames delivers a focused portfolio of internally developed titles, each engineered with some of the lowest house edges available online.</p>\n<p><strong>House Edge as a Foundation of Long-Term Value</strong></p>\n<p>In gambling mathematics, house edge defines the casino\u2019s statistical advantage over time. While short-term outcomes can vary, long-term results are shaped almost entirely by this single metric. Even small differences in house edge can have a measurable impact when applied across a high volume of bets.</p>\n<p>CryptoGames emphasizes transparency in house edge as a core aspect of its platform design. The platform offers low-margin games, which may result in higher value retention for players over extended periods of play, compared to traditional online casinos where house edges typically range from 4% to 10%.</p>\n<p><strong>In-House Development Enables Competitive Margins</strong></p>\n<p>All games on CryptoGames are developed internally. This approach removes the need for third-party licensing fees and external profit margins, allowing the platform to operate efficiently while offering leaner house edges.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard House Edge Across Games</strong></p>\n<p>CryptoGames maintains consistent and competitive margins across its game selection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dice \u2013 1.0%</li>\n<li>DiceV2 \u2013 1.0%</li>\n<li>Keno \u2013 1.0%</li>\n<li>Minesweeper \u2013 1.0%</li>\n<li>Blackjack \u2013 1.25%</li>\n<li>Roulette \u2013 2.7%</li>\n<li>Plinko \u2013 1.72%</li>\n<li>Slot \u2013 1.97%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Lottery game stands out with a 0.0% house edge, an uncommon structure that reinforces CryptoGames\u2019 commitment to fairness and transparency.</p>\n<p>By comparison, these margins offer players a measurable advantage over conventional casino offerings over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Provably Fair Technology Built Into Every Bet</strong></p>\n<p>Transparency is reinforced through full implementation of provably fair gaming across the CryptoGames platform.</p>\n<p>Before each wager, the server seed is hashed and presented to the player. Once the bet concludes, the original seed is revealed, allowing independent verification of the outcome using the published algorithm.</p>\n<p>By design, this eliminates one of the most common trust concerns in online gambling.</p>\n<p><strong>Broad Cryptocurrency Support and Flexible Access</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://crypto.games/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CryptoGames</a> supports betting with 14 cryptocurrencies, accommodating a wide range of blockchain users.</p>\n<p>Through ChangeNow integration, users can also deposit more than 50 additional altcoins, which are automatically converted into supported assets. For those new to crypto, CryptoGames integrates the Swapped fiat-to-crypto gateway, enabling purchases via credit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.</p>\n<p><strong>Ongoing Rewards Designed for Consistent Engagement</strong></p>\n<p>CryptoGames emphasizes long-term engagement through recurring rewards rather than one-time promotional offers.</p>\n<p><strong>Monthly Wagering Contest With Major Prize Pools</strong></p>\n<p>The platform hosts a monthly wagering contest offering rewards of up to $500,000 USD, depending on market conditions.</p>\n<p>Leaderboards are separated by cryptocurrency, ensuring fair competition among players using the same assets. Participants also receive lottery tickets throughout the month, adding additional reward opportunities tied to consistent participation.</p>\n<p><strong>VIP Program Focused on Statistical Advantage</strong></p>\n<p>CryptoGames\u2019 VIP program is tailored for high-volume and competitive players.</p>\n<p><strong>VIP Benefits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduced dice house edge of 0.8%</li>\n<li>Removal of server-side betting delays</li>\n<li>Increased daily exchange limits up to 1 BTC</li>\n<li>Access to a private VIP chat room</li>\n<li>VIP chat identification</li>\n<li>$100 Bitcoin birthday bonus (Tier 3 KYC required)</li>\n<li>Additional faucet level</li>\n<li>Monthly voucher distributions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Players who maintain VIP status for three consecutive months retain most benefits even if they do not immediately requalify, reinforcing long-term loyalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Optimized User Experience and Community Engagement</strong></p>\n<p>CryptoGames delivers a clean, high-performance interface designed for speed and efficiency. Betting remains smooth even at high volumes. An active chatbox, blog, and forum further support transparency and community interaction.</p>\n<p><strong>A Platform Built for Fairness, Strategy, and Confidence</strong></p>\n<p>With more than 9.5 billion Dice bets placed, <a href=\"https://crypto.games/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CryptoGames</a> continues to demonstrate the scalability and reliability of its provably fair systems.

Last week, the token\u00a0<a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/pi-networks-pi-crashed-to-new-atl-but-this-metric-signals-more-downside-ahead/\" target=\"_blank\">slipped</a> to a new all-time low of approximately $0.13, and as of press time, it is worth roughly $0.14, representing a staggering 95% collapse from the historical peak.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/pinetworkmember/status/2020556790786642007\">According</a> to X user pinetworkmembers, the decline is not &#8220;a healthy correction,&#8221; but a market pricing of the biggest issues of the controversial project behind the cryptocurrency:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;That\u2019s not a healthy correction, that\u2019s the market finally pricing in the obvious: no functioning mainnet after years of promises, no real-world utility beyond \u2018keep the app open\u2019, and a whole lot of mobile mining theater.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>They\u00a0 claimed that at first PI was sold as &#8220;revolutionary,&#8221; but eventually ended up appearing like &#8220;the longest-running pyramid scheme dressed up as Web3 empowerment for hopeful retirees and late-night scrollers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They opined that Pi Network users (known as Pioneers) should admit that the experiment failed and redirect their energy toward something more productive that can actually bring them profit.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;RIP to the bags still being held. Touch some grass, seriously,&#8221; the X user concluded.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time the project has become the subject of criticism. Earlier this month, Pi Network&#8217;s Core Team <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/7-years-waiting-pi-network-users-criticize-core-team-after-celebratory-post/\">celebrated</a> the so-called &#8220;Moderator Appreciation Day.&#8221; The event aimed to acknowledge moderators and praise their role in building and supporting the community.</p>\n<p>The statement, however, triggered significant backlash, as many members argued that the project should focus on more pressing issues, such as expediting the verification process and related tasks.</p>\n<h2>What Lies Ahead?</h2>\n<p>Several concerning factors, including the upcoming token unlocks, suggest PI&#8217;s price could fall further in the short term. Data shows that nearly 250 million coins will be released over the next 30 days, resulting in an average daily unlock of more than 8.3 million.</p>\n<p>February 13 is expected to be the record day, when 23.6 million PI will be freed up. While the development doesn&#8217;t guarantee an additional price collapse, it can be considered bearish because it increases the selling pressure.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_1428313\" style=\"width: 1391px;\"><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PI-Token-Unlocks-1.png\"><img alt=\"PI Token Unlocks\" class=\"wp-image-1428313\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PI-Token-Unlocks-1.png\" width=\"1391\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1428313\">PI Token Unlocks, Source: piscan.io</figcaption></figure>\n<p>On the other hand, PI&#8217;s Relative Strength Index (RSI) signals that a rebound could also be on the horizon. The technical analysis tool measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes and helps traders identify potential reversal points. It varies from 0 to 100, and ratios below 30 indicate that PI has entered oversold territory and may be due for a resurgence.

Trading activity surged last week, which drove exchange-traded product (ETP) volumes to a record-breaking $63.1 billion.</p>\n<p>This figure exceeded the previous peak of $56.4 billion recorded in October of the prior year. The strong activity indicates increased investor interest and momentum.</p>\n<p>Investor sentiment was negative for Bitcoin, which experienced $264 million in outflows, alongside $11.6 million moving out of short positions. On the other hand, altcoins attracted fresh capital, as XRP led with $63.1 million, Solana $8.2 million, and Ethereum $5.3 million.

Franco added,</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Regulatory developments like the recent Clarity Bill and advancing market-structure legislation will also positively impact crypto markets by providing clearer compliance frameworks that reduce uncertainty and make these assets more attractive to institutions and traditional funds.

The arena of the match was Levi&#8217;s Stadium, while the two teams competing for the title were the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots.</p>\n<p>This particular match is usually the most heavily bet-on single sporting event in the United States. One popular person who tried his luck on it was the rapper Drake.</p>\n<p>He revealed on his personal Instagram account that he wagered a whopping $1 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) on the New England Patriots to win the game.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_1428265\" style=\"width: 738px;\"><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WhatsApp-Image-2026-02-09-at-09.39.49.jpeg\"><img alt=\"Drake's Bet on Super Bowl\" class=\"wp-image-1428265 size-full\" height=\"1009\" src=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WhatsApp-Image-2026-02-09-at-09.39.49.jpeg\" width=\"738\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-1428265\">Drake&#8217;s Bet on Super Bowl, Source: Instagram</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The odds were set at 2.95, meaning Drake would have made a profit of almost $2 million worth of the cryptocurrency had the team been victorious. Unfortunately for him, the Seattle Seahawks became champions after <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/live/cr5ey01yj8nt\">beating</a> their opponents 29-13.</p>\n<h2>The Previous Bets</h2>\n<p>While the musician seems to be a huge fan of betting on various sports events, he rarely picks the right horse. In 2022, he <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/how-drake-lost-600k-worth-of-btc-betting-on-football/\">wagered</a> a little over $600,000 worth of BTC on the English football club Arsenal to beat Leeds United and on FC Barcelona to win &#8220;El Cl\u00e1sico&#8221; versus its biggest rival, Real Madrid. The team from Spain&#8217;s capital won the game, leaving Drake to taste defeat once again.</p>\n<p>At the start of 2024, the Canadian tried his luck with UFC, <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/here-is-how-much-bitcoin-btc-drake-lost-betting-on-ufc-match/\">betting</a> $700,000 worth of BTC on Sean Strickland to beat Dricus du Plessis. The latter, though, won after a split decision from the judges.</p>\n<p>Several months later, he tried a really risky bet. He <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/heres-how-much-bitcoin-btc-drake-lost-after-argentina-qualified-for-copa-americas-final/\">wagered</a> $300,000 in the primary cryptocurrency on Canada&#8217;s national football team to win against the reigning world champion Argentina. The odds for the North American country were almost 10, meaning Drake would have made a substantial profit. Somewhat expectedly, however, the team captained by Lionel Messi won by 2-0.</p>\n<p>Those losses (and many more) over the years gave rise to the so-called &#8220;Drake curse.&#8221; It is a popular Internet meme that refers to the pattern where the rapper publicly supports or bets on a club or athlete, only for them to lose in the aftermath.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/heres-how-much-bitcoin-btc-drake-lost-betting-on-the-super-bowl/\">Here&#8217;s How Much Bitcoin (BTC) Drake Lost Betting on the Super Bowl</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CryptoPotato</a>.</p>", "sentiment": "neutral", "categories": "macro", "coins": "BTC,ADA"}}

The recent sell-off has pushed it into a historically reactive demand region of $60K, while broader risk sentiment remains fragile. The market is approaching a juncture where technical structure, higher-timeframe demand, and on-chain liquidity dynamics converge, making the coming sessions critical for short- to mid-term direction.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart</h2>\n<p>On the daily timeframe, Bitcoin remains structurally bearish, as the price has been printing major lower highs and has reached the channel\u2019s lower boundary. The recent sell-off also resulted in a clear breach of the prior major daily low around $75K, confirming a breakdown in market structure and triggering forced liquidation flows.</p>\n<p>However, once the asset reached the $60K\u2013$62K demand zone, selling pressure decelerated sharply. This area has historically acted as a high-interest accumulation region, and the latest reaction reinforces its relevance. Since tapping this zone, Bitcoin has managed to recover toward the $69K\u2013$70K region, but the rebound has lacked momentum and follow-through.</p>\n<p>The daily chart now reflects balance rather than trend. Sellers are no longer pressing prices lower aggressively, yet buyers are also unable to reclaim the former support at $75K\u2013$77K, which has now transitioned into a clear supply zone. As long as Bitcoin remains capped below that area, the broader daily bias stays cautious, with consolidation favored over continuation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/BTC-D-3-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1428280\" height=\"1481\" src=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/BTC-D-3-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2560\" /></a></p>\n<h2>BTC/USDT 4-Hour Chart</h2>\n<p>Zooming into the 4-hour timeframe, it is evident that the price has rebounded from the $60K threshold, and is now oscillating around $69K\u2013$70K. The character of price action has shifted from impulsive candles to overlapping ranges, signaling exhaustion on the sell side.</p>\n<p>The channel\u2019s mid trendline is considered the main supply range near the $73K area, while the internal resistance around the $70K consistently rejects upside attempts. On the downside, demand remains clearly defined between $60K and $62K, where buyers previously stepped in with conviction.</p>\n<p>This creates a compressed environment where Bitcoin is effectively boxed between a rising demand floor and a descending resistance ceiling. Until price either loses the $60K\u2013$62K support or reclaims $75K with strength, the most probable outcome remains range-bound price action rather than a directional move.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/BTC-4H-3-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1428279\" height=\"1481\" src=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/BTC-4H-3-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2560\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin has now reached the realized price of the 18-month to 2-year holder cohort, placing this group in a breakeven state. This level, located around the $60K range, is particularly important because it often acts as a behavioral inflection point, where holders are more likely to either defend their cost basis or exit positions if confidence weakens.</p>\n<p>From an on-chain perspective, this realized price currently functions as a key support zone. If buying pressure absorbs supply at this level, the market is likely to stabilize and transition into a consolidation phase. However, failure to hold this area could trigger additional sell pressure as this cohort moves into a loss.</p>\n<p>On the upside, the realized price of the 12-month to 18-month cohort around $85K-$90K now represents a clear resistance, as these holders are underwater and may sell into any relief rally. Overall, Bitcoin is trading at a critical equilibrium zone where consolidation is favored unless a decisive break occurs in either direction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Bitcoin-Realized-Price-UTXO-Age-Bands-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1428278\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Bitcoin-Realized-Price-UTXO-Age-Bands-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2560\" /></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-why-the-60k-62k-zone-is-make-or-break/\">Bitcoin Price Analysis: Why the $60K-$62K Zone Is Make or Break</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CryptoPotato</a>.</p>", "sentiment": "negative", "categories": "defi,whale,pump", "coins": "BTC,SOL,NEAR"}}

Japanese Government Bonds, sidelined for years by ultra-low yields, are attracting incremental capital as fiscal expansion raises reflation expectations.</p>\n<p>That rotation has coincided with a pullback in U.S. equities. Over the past seven days, the Nasdaq Composite fell about 5.6%, the S&amp;P 500 slipped by about 2.7%, and the Russell 2000 dropped close to 2.6%.</p>\n<p>A stronger dollar, driven by yen weakness and persistent rate gaps between the U.S. and Japan, has tightened financial conditions further. In these risk-off phases, Bitcoin has tended to move alongside U.S. equities, allowing equity-led de-risking to spill into crypto markets.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe Takaichi Trade strengthens Japan but puts pressure on the U.S. and Bitcoin,\u201d wrote GugaOnChain. \u201cThe capital flight to JGBs and a robust dollar create an environment of inevitable adjustments, requiring investors to closely monitor the correlation between U.S. indexes and crypto assets.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Weak Sentiment Now, Policy Tailwinds Later</h2>\n<p>At the time of writing, BTC was trading just below $71,000, up about 2% on the day but down more than 6% over the past week and nearly 22% in the last month.</p>\n<p>Adding to the feeling of fragility in the market, the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-fear-and-greed-index-plummets-to-6-year-low-is-the-worst-over/\">fell</a> to a 6-year low on February 7 after BTC slid from above $90,000 in late January to near $60,000 before rebounding.</p>\n<p>CryptoQuant\u2019s latest report <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/cryptoquant-breaks-down-current-bear-market-signals/\">shows</a> Bitcoin trading below its 365-day moving average, with spot and institutional demand weak and liquidity tightening, all common features of a bear phase.</p>\n<p>Still, Japan\u2019s political backdrop looks different beyond the immediate risk-off trade. With a two-thirds majority, Takaichi\u2019s administration has room to pursue legislative changes, and officials have previously framed Web3 as an industrial policy focus. As such, analysts expect discussions around crypto tax reform and stablecoin rules to resume.</p>\n<p>As XWIN concluded,</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cNear-term pressure on U.S. equities and Bitcoin is macro-driven, while Japan\u2019s institutional reforms may support crypto markets longer term.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/why-japans-election-is-a-short-term-drag-but-long-term-win-for-bitcoin/\">Why Japan\u2019s Election Is a Short-Term Drag but Long-Term Win for Bitcoin</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CryptoPotato</a>.</p>", "sentiment": "neutral", "categories": "regulation,macro,institutional,defi,layer2", "coins": "BTC,NEAR,OP,TRX"}}

But prominent market commentators believe that the carnage is not yet over.</p>\n<p>Doctor Profit, for one, believes that the asset is entering an extended sideways phase that is not a bullish consolidation but is a preparation for a deeper decline in the months ahead.</p>\n<h2>Sideways, Then Down</h2>\n<p>According to the analyst&#8217;s findings, Bitcoin is forming a new trading &#8220;box&#8221; between roughly $57,000 and $87,000, which represents a wide 33% range. He expects the price action to remain largely range-bound within these levels for weeks or even months.</p>\n<p>Doctor Profit <a href=\"https://x.com/DrProfitCrypto/status/2020427592093032523\">stated</a> that this sideways behavior should not be interpreted as strength, but instead as a structural phase that typically precedes a breakdown in a broader bear market. Drawing a parallel to 2024, the analyst said BTC spent an entire year consolidating between $58,000 and $74,000 before breaking out above $100,000, and he repeatedly warned at the time that this range would later serve as a reference level during the next bear market.</p>\n<p>That scenario is now playing out: Bitcoin is once again trading in the same price zone, but this time in a bearish context, where former consolidation areas act as structure rather than durable support. He expects that once the current sideways phase is complete, the crypto asset will break down below the box and end up targeting the $44,000-$50,000 region in the coming weeks or months.</p>\n<p>Doctor Profit said that he is buying spot Bitcoin between $57,000 and $60,000, which he considers the local bottom of the current range, but not the final macro bottom of the bear market. He added that this area is likely to be tested multiple times during the sideways phase, which makes it suitable for range trades, while upside during this period could extend as high as $87,000, depending on market strength.</p>\n<p>However, the analyst made it clear that $87,000 is not a guaranteed target and merely represents the upper boundary of what he expects during the consolidation. If price does approach that level, he said he would consider adding to existing short positions opened between $115,000 and $125,000, which he continues to hold in full.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, there is no immediate major downside while the market remains range-bound, as per Doctor Profit&#8217;s analysis. He <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-rebounds-above-76k-but-analysts-see-cycle-bottom-much-lower/\">described</a> the coming period as &#8220;long and boring&#8221; while adding that the most aggressive long-term buying will only occur much lower, between the low $50,000s and the low $40,000s, where he believes Bitcoin will ultimately bottom, potentially around September or October.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are in a bear market.

The sell-off following this breach has been sharp and impulsive, indicating forced participation rather than controlled distribution.</p>\n<p>The price has sliced through multiple previously respected demand areas with minimal response, which signals that resting buy-side liquidity at those levels has already been consumed. The current interaction with the broader demand zone near the channel\u2019s lower boundary of $1.00 is therefore critical. This zone represents one of the last visible higher-timeframe areas where untested demand may still exist.</p>\n<p>However, the lack of meaningful absorption so far suggests that sellers remain in control, and any stabilization here would need to be confirmed through time rather than a single reaction.</p>\n<p>From a daily perspective, XRP remains vulnerable as long as the price trades below the former reaction zones overhead, which are now structurally acting as supply.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/XRP-D-2-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1428216\" height=\"1481\" src=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/XRP-D-2-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2560\" /></a></p>\n<h2>XRP/USDT 4-Hour Chart</h2>\n<p>Zooming into the 4-hour timeframe, the influx of sellers is more evident, with the price aggressively reaching the $1.00 threshold.

ETH Hits Critical Demand Zone (Ethereum Price Analysis)", "content": "<p>Ethereum remains under heavy bearish pressure, with recent price action confirming a continuation of the broader downtrend. The market is currently reacting to a major sell-side expansion, and both technical structure and on-chain liquidity dynamics suggest that the asset is still navigating a critical phase where downside targets remain relevant, even if short-term relief bounces occur.</p>\n<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart</h2>\n<p>On the daily timeframe, ETH is clearly trading within a well-defined descending channel, with the price recently accelerating toward the lower boundary of this structure. The most important observation on the chart is the clean breakdown below multiple prior support levels, followed by a sharp impulsive leg to the downside. This move confirms strong bearish acceptance rather than a simple liquidity sweep.</p>\n<p>The asset has now reached a major higher-timeframe demand zone, located around the $1.8K region, which previously acted as a base during earlier accumulation phases. The reaction off this zone has produced a modest bounce, but so far this move lacks structural strength and remains corrective in nature.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the market is likely to enter a consolidation-correction phase above this crucial support until a decisive breakout occurs. The main supply zone during this consolidation range is the channel\u2019s middle line, located at the $2.3K threshold. A break above this resistance will open the door for an extended bullish retracement toward the $2.5K significant resistance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ETH-D-2-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1428214\" height=\"1481\" src=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ETH-D-2-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2560\" /></a></p>\n<h2>ETH/USDT 4-Hour Chart</h2>\n<p>Zooming into the 4-hour timeframe, the bearish structure becomes even clearer. The most recent price action shows a sharp sell-off into demand, followed by a shallow bounce that lacks impulsive follow-through.</p>\n<p>Crucially, the rebound appears corrective and technically opens the door for a pullback toward the most recent supply zones and Fibonacci levels, located around the $2.3K to $2.6K region. These areas align with prior breakdown levels and correspond to zones where sellers previously intervened aggressively. If the price retraces into these levels without strong volume or momentum, they are likely to act as rejection zones rather than breakout points.</p>\n<p>Until Ethereum can reclaim and hold above these supply areas, the 4-hour structure continues to favour continuation to the downside or extended consolidation within the lower range, rather than a trend reversal.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ETH-4H-3-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1428213\" height=\"1481\" src=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ETH-4H-3-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2560\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>\n<p>The ETH liquidation heatmap over the last 6 months provides critical confirmation of the bearish technical structure. A significant concentration of liquidity has been built around and just below the $2K level, which has recently acted as a strong magnet for price. The sharp sell-off into this area confirms that downside liquidity was actively targeted, resulting in a large flush of leveraged long positions.</p>\n<p>Despite this liquidation event, the heatmap still reveals residual liquidity pockets extending slightly below current price levels, indicating that the market may not have fully exhausted its downside objectives yet. These remaining clusters continue to exert gravitational pull on price, especially if spot demand remains weak and derivatives positioning rebuilds on the long side too quickly.</p>\n<p>That said, the intensity of liquidations around the $2K zone suggests that a meaningful portion of forced selling has already occurred. This reduces immediate liquidation pressure and explains the short-term stabilization seen after the drop. However, from an on-chain perspective, this behavior supports consolidation or corrective rebounds, not a confirmed trend reversal, unless liquidity interest decisively shifts back above current levels.</p>\n<p>In summary, on-chain data aligns closely with the technical picture: Ethereum is still operating in a bearish liquidity-driven environment, with downside risks remaining active as long as price fails to reclaim key supply zones and attract sustained spot demand.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ETH-Liquidation-Heatmap6-month-2026-02-08_10_09_06-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1428212\" height=\"1877\" src=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ETH-Liquidation-Heatmap6-month-2026-02-08_10_09_06-scaled.jpg\" width=\"2560\" /></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/is-1-8k-the-bottom-eth-hits-critical-demand-zone-ethereum-price-analysis/\">Is $1.8K the Bottom?

The first few attempts looked like the market pressing its face against the glass. The seventh looked like the market stepping back, glancing at the door, and choosing a softer run-up.</p>\n<p>That is how breakouts fade, quietly, candle by candle.</p>\n<p>On the chart, it reads like short sentences. Attempts one, two, three, all reaching into the same ceiling. Attempts four, five, six, same ceiling, same hesitation, same lack of follow-through. Attempt seven, smaller, earlier, less committed. Then the drift returns.</p>\n<p>We are back around the high $60,000s, and the conversation now shifts. The market spent days asking when $71,500 breaks. Now it has to answer a different question, how many tries does a market get before the crowd stops believing?</p>\n<p>Each time price hits a level like $71,500 and fails, the market learns. Short sellers get braver. Profit takers get quicker. Long positions tighten stops. The crowd that promised themselves they would sell at break-even gets closer to the button.</p>\n<h2>The ETF era and its misconceptions</h2>\n<p>The strange part is how calm it can look.</p>\n<p>The damage can arrive as boredom, a slow leak of conviction, a market that returns to the same place and turns around a little earlier each time.</p>\n<p>That is where we are now.</p>\n<p>The emotional part is easy to understand. The mechanical part is where the follow up matters, because something else has been shifting under the surface that makes this ceiling heavier than it looked two days ago.</p>\n<p>Over the last month, the spot Bitcoin ETF flow picture has started to tell a more complicated story.</p>\n<p>A single day can look healthy. One day can deliver a burst of demand. The longer window shows whether that demand stays.</p>\n<p>The aggregate U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF complex recorded $220 million in net inflows yesterday but remains -$347 million over 7 days and about -$2.659 billion over 30 days.</p>\n<p>That 30-day figure matters because it changes the mood around the story people reach for during bounces.</p>\n<p>For months, traders treated ETF demand like a backstop, a safety net under every dip, a thing you could lean on without thinking too hard. Now the net flow picture says the bid shows up in bursts, then fades, then returns, and the month-long line has pointed down.</p>\n<p>That keeps ETFs relevant, and it also keeps the market honest. Flows deserve the same treatment as price, trend over headline.</p>\n<p>Combine that with repeated $71,500 failures, and you get a cleaner read on why this level keeps winning. A reclaim needs sustained pressure, sustained demand, and a reason for sellers to step aside.</p>\n<p>Right now, the market is trying to do it with fatigue in the candles and a monthly flow backdrop that has stayed net <a href=\"https://www.walletpilot.com/bitcoin-tracker/etfs\">negative</a>.</p>\n<h2>Macro impact on Bitcoin price</h2>\n<p>Then comes the macro layer, the part everyone pretends stays in the background until it grabs the wheel.</p>\n<p>The U.S. 10 year yield has been <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10/\">sitting</a> in the low 4s, with recent prints around 4.22%. You do not need to trade bonds to understand what that does to a market like Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>High yields tighten conditions. They make leverage pricier. They change how risk gets priced. They raise the bar for speculative assets to keep pushing higher without taking a breath.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin can still rally in that environment, and the path usually looks messier, and failures usually sting more, because the room has less oxygen.</p>\n<p>Lately, you can see the market pricing that stress through options.</p>\n<p>A volatility spike in Deribit\u2019s DVOL index broke during the late January shakeout. Deribit has also <a href=\"https://insights.deribit.com/industry/btc-longer-dated-skew-flipping-into-put-premium/\">written</a> about longer dated skew flipping toward put premium, which is another way of saying traders are paying up for downside protection.</p>\n<p>You do not need to live in options land to feel what that implies.</p>\n<p>When traders pay more for protection, the market gets jumpier. Ranges widen. Bounces get sold faster. Complacency gets expensive.</p>\n<p>That is the emotional backdrop sitting underneath this technical setup.</p>\n<p>And the setup itself has gotten simpler since my last article.</p>\n<p>It still runs through $71,500, and now it also runs through the idea that the market has started to ration conviction.</p>\n<h2>The $71,500 ceiling has turned into a public pressure test</h2>\n<p>I keep circling the same line because Bitcoin keeps repeating the same behavior.</p>\n<p>$71,500 has become the place where the market has to prove it can stand up again.</p>\n<p>In the original piece, I wrote about the difference between a wick and a reclaim.

By measuring the balance of pessimistic and optimistic language tied directly to specific assets, traders can better filter out noise and identify moments when fear dominates discourse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharp spikes in fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-fud/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">and pessimistic commentary</a> across social media in past instances have been followed by market rebounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&amp;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&ldquo;Bottoming out at $60,001 back on Thursday, cryptocurrency&rsquo;s top market cap asset rebounded a staggering +19% in just under 24 hours following the FUD,&rdquo; the post read. &ldquo;When negativity gets high, it&rsquo;s usually because prices are getting low in a hurry. And once you see the predictions of doom for cryptocurrency, it&rsquo;s generally the best time to officially buy the dip.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Negative Commentary as a Dip Buying Signal\" class=\"wp-image-800769\" src=\"https://assets.beincrypto.com/img/R-lpPwH9fVcJUXhnsv5ltG-8ey0=/smart/f7fd22ddbc2d40e7a02091ba41da4357\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Negative Commentary as a Dip Buying Signal.

This is because markets can rebound before retail traders fully capitulate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more telling sign, according to the platform, is the shift in language from &ldquo;dip&rdquo; to more extreme <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/arthur-hayes-explains-what-crashed-bitcoin/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">terms like &ldquo;crash.&rdquo; </a>When catastrophic language begins to dominate discussions, it suggests fear-driven capitulation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Santiment also highlighted the value of monitoring trending bearish keywords. This includes &ldquo;selling,&rdquo; &ldquo;down,&rdquo; or narratives suggesting assets are &ldquo;going to $0,&rdquo; which often emerge when retail confidence breaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final signal comes from on-chain data, specifically the 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This metric measures whether recently active wallets are, on average, in profit or at a loss. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When MVRV enters the &ldquo;strongly undervalued&rdquo; zone, it indicates that the most recent buyers are underwater. This condition could precede market rebounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&amp;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&ldquo;As the &lsquo;zone&rsquo; graphics indicate, you typically want to avoid being heavily invested in an asset when it is above the &lsquo;Strongly Overvalued Zone.&rsquo; But on the flip side, there is great upside to buying while it is below the &ldquo;Strongly Undervalued Zone.&rdquo; Santiment added.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The analysis stressed that defining what constitutes a &ldquo;dip&rdquo; largely depends on market context and the timeframe a trader is operating on. A short-term move of around 1.7% may present an opportunity for hourly swing traders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the platform noted that most market participants tend to react on a weekly basis. This better reflects the realistic trading bandwidth of the average trader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/mastering-crypto-trading-emotions/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">relying on intuition or &ldquo;anecdotal things,&rdquo;</a> the firm argues that objective data offers clearer insight into when fear-driven sell-offs may be nearing exhaustion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth noting that buying decisions ultimately depend on individual investor preferences and time horizons. While Santiment&rsquo;s signals can help identify periods of heightened fear and potential opportunity, they do not guarantee that a market rebound will follow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At present, many <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/crypto-market-sentiment-bearish-2026-analysis/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">analysts suggest that</a> the broader bear market may <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-four-year-halving-cycle-analysis/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">still have room to run</a>. This means that prices could remain under pressure for longer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, decisions to buy or hold should be guided by each investor&rsquo;s risk tolerance, strategy, and opportunity cost considerations.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/crypto-buy-the-dip-signals-santiment-analysis/\">When Is the Right Time to Buy the Crypto Dip?

This threshold has historically coincided with market bottoms rather than prolonged sell-offs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When profitable supply compresses to these levels, selling incentives weaken.

Value-oriented buyers tend to enter when downside risk appears limited relative to upside potential.

The Pi Cycle Top Indicator, which compares the 111-day moving average to a doubled 350-day moving average, remains far from <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-70k-pump-or-crash-analysis/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">signaling BTC overheating</a>. This indicator historically flags major tops when the shorter average crosses the higher threshold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the opposite setup is unfolding. The shorter moving average is diverging below the longer one, signaling cooling conditions rather than excess speculation. In past cycles, such divergence often preceded sustained rebounds as Bitcoin reset from overheated levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"Bitcoin Pi Cyle Top Indicator\" class=\"wp-image-800757\" src=\"https://assets.beincrypto.com/img/UWVGcfrdoC72S88oCif4oPUVfu4=/smart/fbfb99515413458eaebe84073ec05af4\" style=\"width: 1024px; height: auto;\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bitcoin Pi Cyle Top Indicator.

Since March 2023, Bitcoin has maintained a macro uptrend without excessive overheating. Gradual price appreciation limited speculative excess, making this the first clear bottom signal in nearly three years rather than a sharp capitulation-driven low.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-btc-price-levels-to-watch\">BTC Price Levels To Watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the short term, Bitcoin is holding above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement near $63,007. At the time of writing, BTC trades around $68,905, maintaining support despite repeated tests. However, price remains capped below the $71,672 resistance, limiting immediate upside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If on-chain signals continue holding and inflows strengthen, Bitcoin could break above $71,672. Such a move would open the path toward $78,676. Stronger confirmation of recovery would come <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bernstein-bitcoin-bear-market-prediction-us-crypto-news/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">only if BTC reclaims</a> $85,680 as a sustained support level.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"Bitcoin Price Analysis. \" class=\"wp-image-800755\" src=\"https://assets.beincrypto.com/img/jOHx8lEf-a0AZ509SgmGjnShNIE=/smart/0ab72223d8734c09b8de1649d6f1e22b\" style=\"width: 1024px; height: auto;\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bitcoin Price Analysis.

Trading infrastructure has gone digital, execution is instantaneous, and information moves globally in real time. Yet most traditional markets still shut down on nights, weekends, and holidays.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where TradFi intersects with crypto-native infrastructure. Platforms like <strong>Phemex</strong> are narrowing that gap by listing <a href=\"https://phemex.com/tradfi?group=8127&amp;referralCode=CUFKP8\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">TradFi futures</a>&mdash;price-tracking contracts tied to assets such as gold and silver&mdash;on infrastructure built for continuous markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-spot-trading-vs-futures-contracts\">Spot trading vs futures contracts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spot and futures markets work differently, and that difference explains why TradFi futures matter. Put simply, spot trading means you buy the asset itself at the current price, whereas a futures contract tracks price under contract terms rather than giving direct ownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In traditional spot trading, buying a share or commodity involves a complex chain of custody, legal ownership transfer, and T+2 settlement cycles. This infrastructure requires banks and clearinghouses to be open, which is why trading halts on weekends and holidays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A futures contract is a derivative, an agreement based on the price of an asset, not the exchange of the asset itself. Because of this, there is no physical action or need for a transfer in the event of a closed exchange market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the market closes, only the conventional infrastructure ceases to function; assets retain their worth.<strong> Phemex fills this gap by delivering a marketplace where price discovery and risk management continue uninterrupted.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-macro-news-don-t-wait-for-monday\">Macro News Don&rsquo;t Wait for Monday</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional finance (TradFi) and cryptocurrency markets are increasingly moving in the same direction. As crypto trading has matured, digital asset prices have become more closely linked to macroeconomic indicators that have long driven equities and commodities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interest rate decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve, inflation data, labor market reports, and geopolitical developments now influence both stock indices and major cryptocurrencies. This growing correlation has reshaped how traders think about risk, timing, and market access across asset classes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of TradFi futures on crypto-native trading platforms allows traders to respond to macroeconomic developments in real time. Instead of waiting for traditional market hours, traders can hedge positions or manage volatility as events unfold&mdash;an approach that is increasingly central to modern risk management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it is hedging a position or capitalizing on volatility, the ability to execute trades based on real-time macro news is no longer a luxury,; it is a necessity for modern risk management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-tradfi-futures-matter-for-24-7-market-access\">Why TradFi Futures Matter for 24/7 Market Access</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 24/7 openness of markets, remaining functional even during holidays and non-working days, is not merely a new generation innovation; it represents the natural evolutionary progression of trading. In the traditional financial world, when the market is closed, uncertainty and suspense tend to take hold.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a major event occurs over the weekend, traditional investors face significant gap risk, where the price jumps or drops substantially between Friday&rsquo;s close and Monday&rsquo;s open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through TradFi futures trading found on Phemex, traders can manage their positions at any time, day or night. This eliminates the waiting game that often leaves investors vulnerable to global news cycles that do not stop for bank holidays.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-unified-trading-across-crypto-and-tradfi-futures-on-a-single-platform-nbsp\">Unified Trading Across Crypto and TradFi Futures on a Single Platform&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phemex</strong> focuses on reducing the liquidity and access friction typical of traditional markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform offers <a href=\"https://phemex.com/tradfi?group=8127&amp;referralCode=CUFKP8\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>USDT-settled derivatives</strong> </a>linked to traditional assets such as gold, silver, and selected stocks, alongside crypto derivatives. This structure allows traders to access multiple asset classes from a single account, without opening separate brokerage relationships or navigating lengthy funding and settlement processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(USDT-settled derivatives mean that profits and losses are settled in USDT rather than through delivery of the underlying asset.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phemex operates a <strong>unified margin system</strong>, enabling the same USDT balance to be used across gold, silver, and crypto futures. Because these contracts track price rather than involve physical settlement, custody and operational complexity are reduced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with cryptocurrency perpetual contracts, TradFi futures can be traded with leverage, allowing traders to increase exposure and improve capital efficiency without committing the full notional amount typically required by traditional brokers. Historically, access to equities or commodities&mdash;whether via direct ownership, ETFs, or futures&mdash;often required substantial upfront capital and fragmented infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As demand grows for continuous market access and more flexible risk management, crypto-native platforms are increasingly addressing these structural limitations.

As crypto and traditional assets increasingly respond to the same macro forces, their separation at the infrastructure level has started to break down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The objective isn&rsquo;t to replicate stock exchanges on crypto platforms. It&rsquo;s to build faster, more flexible systems that allow traders to access traditional asset exposure with the efficiency they expect from modern markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phemex</strong> is approaching this by replacing ownership friction with futures-based access. By using price-tracking contracts rather than physical settlement, traditional assets can be traded alongside crypto within a unified, USDT-settled environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving into the second quarter of 2026, trading across asset classes from a single margin currency is no longer a differentiator; it&rsquo;s becoming the baseline for how modern markets operate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>As part of the launch of its TradFi futures offering, </em><strong><em>Phemex</em></strong><em> has </em><a href=\"https://phemex.com/en/events/token-fiesta/836?group=8127&amp;referralCode=CUFKP8\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>introduced</em></a><em> a limited-time campaign aimed at familiarizing traders with the new product.

This pattern usually represents a pause before another decline, not a trend reversal. In XMR&rsquo;s case, the fall from $799 to $276 created the flagpole. The recent XMR price consolidation is forming a flag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As long as the price remains inside this range, the dominant trend stays bearish. A breakdown below the lower boundary would likely trigger another major leg lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trend indicators are reinforcing this view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exponential moving averages, or EMAs, are weighted price averages that give more importance to recent data. They help identify whether momentum is strengthening or weakening. When shorter-term EMAs fall below longer-term EMAs, it signals deteriorating trend strength.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, Monero&rsquo;s 50-day EMA is moving toward the 100-day EMA. At the same time, the 20-day EMA is drifting toward the 200-day EMA.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Bearish XMR Price Structure\" class=\"wp-image-800716\" src=\"https://assets.beincrypto.com/img/TGIBg61RMJZD1C_IMyAAyTg-WBY=/smart/68759f57d2954c059d57468133b2f5ae\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bearish XMR Price Structure<a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/HEOJm180/?symbol=KRAKEN%3AXMRUSD\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">: TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Want more token insights like this?&nbsp;Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya&rsquo;s Daily Crypto Newsletter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.beincrypto.com/4lUzHZj\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These developing bearish crossovers suggest that short-term momentum continues to weaken relative to the broader trend.

During the week ending February 2, net outflows reached about $7.1 million. This suggested that some buyers were stepping in after the crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this support faded quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the week ending February 9, flows flipped to net inflows of around $768,000. More XMR was moving back onto exchanges than leaving them. This shift happened while the price dipped to $276 and then rebounded to the $327 zone.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Positive Flows\" class=\"wp-image-800719\" src=\"https://assets.beincrypto.com/img/ZSGmK2wS2apNDyOus6jBHmFnRvs=/smart/726812f4b7d348589d8dbdaacacfd148\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Positive Flows: <a href=\"https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/XMR/futures\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Coinglass</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This tells an important story. As soon as the price bounced, selling possibly resumed. Instead of holding for a recovery, many investors possibly used the rebound to reduce exposure. Loss exits replaced by accumulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When outflows turn into inflows during consolidation, it usually signals distribution. Supply is returning to the market. Without steady spot demand, rallies struggle to survive. This also explains why recent recoveries have been shallow. Buyers are not strong enough to absorb the returning supply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With spot demand fading, the burden shifts to derivatives traders. But derivatives data show growing caution.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-falling-open-interest-and-weak-funding-limit-the-xmr-recovery-potential\">Falling Open Interest and Weak Funding Limit the XMR Recovery Potential</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Derivatives markets provide insight into trader confidence and leverage. Open interest measures the total value of active futures contracts. Rising open interest shows that traders are building positions. Falling open interest shows that traders are closing positions and stepping away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In mid-January, Monero&rsquo;s open interest stood near $279 million. By February 10, it had dropped to around $110 million. This represents a decline of more than 60%.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Open Interest Resets\" class=\"wp-image-800718\" src=\"https://assets.beincrypto.com/img/-GufY9BHI6_fRCa797vVRjrpqFY=/smart/bf227ad61c8944a8bade7b2daf7fa426\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Open Interest Resets:<a href=\"https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/XMR/futures\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Coinglass</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a sharp drop indicates that leverage is leaving the market. Traders are reducing risk rather than preparing for a major rebound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, funding rates remain mildly positive. Funding rates reflect the cost traders pay to hold futures positions. When funding is positive, long traders are dominant. When it is negative, short traders dominate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>XMR&rsquo;s funding remains slightly positive, meaning most remaining traders still lean bullish. But without rising open interest, this bias lacks conviction.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"Weighted Funding Rate For XMR\" class=\"wp-image-800722\" src=\"https://assets.beincrypto.com/img/lWuY90Ihl0cfGlLWmsEaYyoO1yk=/smart/69cd96ee0d4d473cbc2cedb8e2ec9c4f\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Weighted Funding Rate For XMR: <a href=\"https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/XMR/futures\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Coinglass</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This combination is weak. Fewer traders are participating, yet optimism has not fully reset.  It also limits the chance of a short squeeze. A short squeeze requires heavy bearish positioning. Without that pressure, upside accelerations are unlikely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With leverage shrinking and spot buyers hesitant, the price lacks fuel for sustained recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-150-is-becoming-key-target-for-the-monero-price\">Why $150 Is Becoming Key Target for the Monero Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With technical, spot, and derivatives signals aligned, downside levels become increasingly important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first major support sits near $314. This area aligns with recent lows and the lower boundary of the bear flag. A decisive break below it would likely confirm continuation lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If $314 fails, downside opens quickly.</", "sentiment": "negative", "categories": "layer2,whale,selloff", "coins": "ETH,SOL,NEAR,OP,TRX"}}

Source: <a href=\"https://research.kaiko.com/insights\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Kaiko</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kaiko says the current price action suggests Bitcoin has transitioned out of the euphoric post-halving phase and into that expected corrective period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth noting that many experts have <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-four-year-cycle-analysis/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">previously challenged</a> Bitcoin&rsquo;s 4-year cycle. They argue that it no longer holds in today&rsquo;s market. In October, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/arthur-hayes-bitcoins-4-year-cycle-is-dead-long-live-liquidity/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Arthur Hayes said the 4-year</a> Bitcoin cycle was over. He pointed instead to global liquidity as the dominant driver of price movements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others have argued that Bitcoin now follows a<a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-market-cycle-institutional-liquidity-outlook-2026/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> </a>5<a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-market-cycle-institutional-liquidity-outlook-2026/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">-year cycle rather</a> than a 4-year one. They cite the growing influence of global liquidity conditions, institutional participation, and broader macroeconomic policy shifts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kaiko acknowledged that structural changes, including spot Bitcoin <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin-etf/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a> adoption, greater regulatory clarity, and a more mature DeFi ecosystem, have distinguished 2024-2025 from previous cycles.&nbsp;Nonetheless, it said these developments have not prevented the expected post-peak retracement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, they have changed how volatility manifests. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded more than $2.1 billion in outflows during the recent sell-off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This amplified downside pressure and demonstrated that institutional access increases liquidity in both directions, not just on the way up. According to Kaiko,</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&amp;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&ldquo;While DeFi infrastructure has shown relative resilience compared to 2022, TVL declines and slowing staking flows indicate no sector is immune to bear market dynamics. Regulatory clarity&nbsp;has proven insufficient to decouple crypto from broader macro risk factors, with Fed uncertainty and risk-asset weakness dominating market direction.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Kaiko also raised the key question now <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-bottom-prediction-analysts-key-levels/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dominating market discussions:</a> where is the bottom? The report explained that Bitcoin&rsquo;s intraday rebound from $60,000 to $70,000 suggests initial support may be forming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, historical precedent shows that <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/bear-market-signs/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bear markets typically </a>take six to 12 months and involve multiple failed rallies before a sustainable bottom is established.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kaiko noted that stablecoin dominance stands at 10.3%, while funding rates have fallen close to zero and futures open interest has dropped by about 55%, signaling significant deleveraging across the market. Still, the firm cautioned that it remains unclear whether current conditions represent early, mid, or late-stage capitulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&amp;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&ldquo;The four-year cycle framework predicts we should be at the 30% mark. Bitcoin is doing exactly what it has done in every previous cycle, but it seems many market participants&nbsp;convinced themselves this time would be different,&rdquo; Kaiko wrote.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As February 2026 progresses, market participants must weigh both sides of this argument.

This level acts as dynamic resistance in downtrends. In early January, a clean break above this EMA triggered a rally of nearly 30%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Momentum is also showing early improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between January 31 and February 9, XRP printed a lower low in price. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator that measures buying and selling pressure, formed a higher low. This bullish divergence suggests that sellers are losing strength.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"XRP Price Structure\" class=\"wp-image-800648\" src=\"https://assets.beincrypto.com/img/059-ipYmZgAx254v_FNVUEWwbRI=/smart/26ff370b28364303afe4344ca012211c\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">XRP Price Structure: <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/HEOJm180/?symbol=COINBASE%3AXRPUSD\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Want more token insights like this?&nbsp;Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya&rsquo;s Daily Crypto Newsletter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.beincrypto.com/4lUzHZj\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On its own, this setup points to a possible bounce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But technical patterns only work when holders are willing to stay invested.

SOPR measures whether coins being moved on-chain are sold in profit or at a loss. When it stays above 1, it shows profit-taking. When it remains below 1, it shows loss-selling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since late January, XRP&rsquo;s SOPR has remained below 1 for more than ten consecutive days.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"SOPR Under 1\" class=\"wp-image-800650\" src=\"https://assets.beincrypto.com/img/NszXUyMcYq-24uCU3T4XjuJIwBE=/smart/61c57c8ee6924876a5771f7f6e250766\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">SOPR Under 1: <a href=\"https://studio.glassnode.com/dashboards/asset-overview?a=XRP&amp;referrer=home_assets_table\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Glassnode</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is unusual. After a 30%+ rebound, short-term traders are normally sitting in profit. That usually pushes SOPR higher. But in XRP&rsquo;s case, profitability never returned. Loss selling continued even as the price recovered. This means many holders are still exiting underwater positions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In simple terms, the market is not seeing confident profit-taking. It is seeing stress-driven exits. To understand who is responsible, we need to look at holder cohorts.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-holder-data-confirms-the-xrp-bounce-is-being-used-to-exit-not-accumulate\">Holder Data Confirms the XRP Bounce Is Being Used to Exit, Not Accumulate</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>HODL Waves group XRP wallets based on how long they have held their coins. This helps identify which investor groups are buying or selling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most striking shift appeared in the 24-hour holder cohort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On February 6, this group controlled about 1% of XRP&rsquo;s circulating supply.

Instead of waiting for a full recovery, they are using rallies to minimize losses.

This mirrors giants like Stripe re-entering crypto with the $1.1B acquisition of Bridge to capture stablecoin flows.

SUBBD uses a decentralized architecture to cut the middleman, but the real differentiator is the AI integration.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just a crypto-native OnlyFans; it\u2019s a suite of tools designed to multiply output. Features like the AI Personal Assistant and Voice Cloning allow influencers to scale their presence beyond physical limits. That matters. It shifts the pitch from &#8216;censorship resistance&#8217; (which frankly only appeals to a niche) to &#8216;revenue optimization,&#8217; which appeals to everyone.

Similarly, Ted Pillows <a href=\"https://x.com/TedPillows/status/2020793544689234109?s=20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">highlighted</a> BTC\u2019s Monday bounce above $70,000, asserting that the key level to defend is the $68,000 support, where the EMA200 sits.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0If the price fails to hold this level, the market observer suggested a deeper correction could be expected, with Bitcoin risking a drop below the recent lows if that level also fails to hold.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ali Martinez <a href=\"https://x.com/alicharts/status/2020884393464869046?s=20\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">hinted</a> that BTC\u2019s bottom might not be in, as \u201cBitcoin has historically bottomed around the \u22121.0 MVRV Pricing Band.\u201d According to the chart shared on X, that level currently sits at $52,040.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BTC To See Leeser Relief Rally?</h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another market watcher highlighted BTC\u2019s macro descending triangle pattern, which it has been <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-to-30000-analysts-warn-btc-crash-could-be-deeper-than-expected/\" rel=\"noopener \" target=\"_blank\">forming</a> in the monthly timeframe since mid-2024, suggesting that its potential bounce could be a \u201clesser relief rally compared to the 2024-2025 advance to the upside.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rekt Capital <a href=\"https://newsletter.rektcapital.co/whats-next-for-bitcoin/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">noted</a> that upon breakdown from its macro triangles, Bitcoin tends to react from the 50-Month EMA. However, it has historically been followed by a downside deviation below this level.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen viewed through the lens of the Macro Descending Triangle, history shows that Bitcoin has consistently failed to revisit the base of the Macro Triangle following breakdowns, which means BTC may fall short of $82.5k on any upcoming relief rally.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the analyst, if BTC can build <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/major-problem-after-bitcoin-drop/\" rel=\"noopener \" target=\"_blank\">support</a> above the $71,000 area, where the post-halving accumulation breakout occurred, the price could attempt a move into the mid-$70,000.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the flagship crypto \u201cis still negotiating whether it will locate itself within the Post-Halving Range,\u201d and has not decisively reclaimed the upper zone of its current range as support, \u201cis instead showing early signs of flipping into resistance on the Weekly timeframe.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, Bitcoin could consolidate around its post-halving range again if the $70,000 mark confirms as resistance. \u201cAt roughly 30% of the way through this part of the market cycle, there remains ample time for further structural movement to unfold but history suggests whatever clustering develops will likely be distributive before continuing additional Bearish Acceleration,\u201d Rekt Capital concluded.</p>\n<img alt=\"bitcoin, btc, btcusdt\" class=\"size-large wp-image-880594\" height=\"613\" src=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/BTCUSDT_2026-02-09_13-59-10.png?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C613\" width=\"860\" />", "sentiment": "negative", "categories": "regulation,whale,mining,selloff,pump", "coins": "BTC,ETH,SOL,TRX"}}

Historically, when Bitcoin goes flat after a run, liquidity trickles down to high-beta infrastructure plays, specifically the ones solving Bitcoin\u2019s scaling headaches. While Bitcoin remains the pristine collateral of the crypto economy, its network congestion and lack of programmability are still major barriers to mass adoption.</p>\n<p>Investors are now looking past the store-of-value narrative toward the execution layer. The market is hunting for protocols that can unlock the nearly $2T of dormant capital on the Bitcoin network.

Users are often forced to choose between speed and security. Bitcoin Hyper fixes this dichotomy with a modular architecture: it uses the Bitcoin L1 for final settlement while deploying a real-time SVM Layer 2 for execution.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Bitcoin Hyper L2 explained.\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-878766\" height=\"456\" src=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-02-10.54.58.png?w=750&#038;resize=700%2C456\" width=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>That\u2019s a massive technical differentiator. By using the Solana Virtual Machine, the network achieves low-latency processing and high throughput that native Bitcoin script simply can&#8217;t support.</p>\n<p>For developers, this integration changes the calculus of building on Bitcoin. The protocol supports Rust-based smart contracts, allowing dApps to run with the performance users expect from modern DeFi, while anchoring their state to Bitcoin\u2019s immutable ledger.</p>\n<p>This &#8216;best of both worlds&#8217; approach, Solana\u2019s speed plus Bitcoin\u2019s trust, aims to solve the friction of high fees and slow block times that have historically plagued the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The utility here extends beyond simple transfers. The infrastructure supports a decentralized Canonical Bridge for seamless $BTC transfers and offers a robust environment for NFT platforms and gaming dApps. By enabling high-speed payments in wrapped BTC and sophisticated DeFi protocols (like lending and staking), the network effectively transforms Bitcoin from a passive asset into a programmable financial instrument.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"btn btn-default\" href=\"https://newsbtc.care/box_7271b6427956901b28f9e1ee77c086e1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">VISIT THE OFFICIAL $HYPER PRESALE SITE</a></p>\n<h2>Whale Accumulation Signals Confidence In Hyper\u2019s $31M Presale</h2>\n<p>Traders often watch &#8216;smart money&#8217; wallet movements to gauge a project&#8217;s viability before the public launch. On-chain metrics for Bitcoin Hyper suggest real interest from high-net-worth individuals positioning themselves ahead of the Token Generation Event (TGE).</p>\n<p>According to the official presale page, $HYPER has already raised over $31M, a figure that underscores strong demand for Bitcoin-native DeFi solutions. With tokens currently priced at $0.0136754, the valuation reflects an early-entry opportunity relative to established L2s like Stacks or fast-execution chains like Solana.</p>\n<p>But even more telling is the behavior of large-volume buyers.

The &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-mvrv-ratio-flashes-signal-last-630-surge/\" rel=\"noopener \" target=\"_blank\">MVRV Ratio</a>&#8221; is a popular on-chain indicator that tracks the ratio between the ETH market cap and Realized Cap.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-lacks-fresh-momentum-realized-cap-declining/\" rel=\"noopener \" target=\"_blank\">Realized Cap</a> here refers to a capitalization model that calculates the asset&#8217;s total value by assuming that the value of each individual token is equal to the spot price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>The last transfer of any token is likely to represent the last time that it changed hands, so the price at its time could be considered as its current cost basis. As such, the Realized Cap essentially measures the sum of the acquisition value of all coins in circulation. In other words, it provides an estimate for the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>As the <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-not-reaching-10000-flawed/\" rel=\"noopener \" target=\"_blank\">market cap</a> can be considered as the value that holders are carrying in the present, its comparison with the Realized Cap in the MVRV Ratio tells us about the profit-loss status of the Ethereum userbase.</p>\n<p>When the value of the MVRV Ratio is greater than 1, it means the investors are in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under this mark suggests the dominance of loss on the network. Historically, profitability swinging to an extreme value either side of 1 has often paved way for reversals in the asset.</p>\n<p>At a high level above 1, this happens because investors become more likely to take their profits the higher that they get. Similarly, below 1, the asset can bottom out as losses dominate and selling pressure runs out.</p>\n<p>The MVRV Pricing Bands is a model that defines price levels for ETH where these behaviors become more apparent. Below is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in this model&#8217;s bands for Ethereum.</p>\n<img alt=\"Ethereum MVRV Pricing Bands\" height=\"2700\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HAoVv_RXUAAUzwR?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096\" width=\"2160\" />\n<p>As is visible in the graph, Ethereum plunged below the 1.0 pricing band corresponding to $2,449 during its slide at the end of January. This means that the overall market went underwater due to the price drawdown.</p>\n<p>With bearish momentum continuing in the first week of February, losses only grew deeper for investors as the asset fell below another pricing band: 0.80. Currently, this level is valued at $1,959.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The last three times Ethereum $ETH dipped below the 0.80 Pricing Band, it marked a market bottom,&#8221; noted the analyst. It now remains to be seen whether the venture below the level would also mark a bottom for the asset this time.</p>\n<h2>ETH Price</h2>\n<p>Ethereum has rebounded a bit since its plunge last week as its price has returned to $2,044, recovering above the 0.80 MVRV pricing band.</p>\n<img alt=\"Ethereum Price Chart\" class=\"size-medium\" height=\"953\" src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/XbTbEOdO/\" width=\"1486\" />", "sentiment": "negative", "categories": "regulation,defi,pump", "coins": "BTC,ETH"}}

Bloomberg reported over the weekend that the concept could amount to a limited bureaucratic revamp, but a more ambitious effort could \u201csee increased volatility and concern over the US central bank&#8217;s independence,\u201d depending on how explicitly it <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/kevin-warsh-bitcoin-regime-shift-jeff-park/\" rel=\"noopener \" target=\"_blank\">links the Fed\u2019s balance sheet decisions</a> to Treasury financing.</p>\n<p>Looming over the idea is the political pressure to treat debt-service costs as a policy constraint. Bloomberg pointed to interest costs \u201crunning at an annual clip of around $1 trillion,\u201d and quoted SGH Macro Advisors\u2019 Tim Duy warning that an accord could be read as something more than process reform. \u201cRather than insulating the Fed, it could look more like a framework for yield-curve control,\u201d Duy said. \u201cA public agreement that synchronizes the Fed\u2019s balance sheet with Treasury financing explicitly ties monetary operations to deficits.\u201d</p>\n\n<h2>Can Bitcoin Get The Bid?</h2>\n<p>In bitcoin circles, the accord conversation is being interpreted through the lens of yield-curve control (YCC) and debt monetization, not just the path of the policy rate.

He is in favor of yield curve control. This means pegging US short-term interest rates to an artificially low level. The Fed commits to buying unlimited amounts above that level to push interest rates down.\u201d</p>\n<p>In that telling, the Fed pegs yields at \u201can artificially low level\u201d and backs the peg with potentially unlimited purchases \u2014 a structure Ekwueme compared to the World War II era. He argued the political logic is straightforward: nominating someone \u201cmore hawkish than Powell\u201d would clash with Trump\u2019s prior attacks on the Fed for being too hawkish, making a dovish tilt the more consistent outcome.</p>\n<p>Bull Theory, a crypto-focused account, <a href=\"https://x.com/BullTheoryio/status/2020802875413397774\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">echoed</a> the historical parallel while stressing that Warsh\u2019s public framing is also about reducing the Fed\u2019s entanglement in long-duration government financing. The account argued Warsh could prefer a portfolio shift toward Treasury bills, a smaller balance sheet, and clearer limits on when large bond-buying programs can occur \u2014 potentially with \u201ccloser coordination with the Treasury on debt issuance.\u201d But it also warned the market shouldn\u2019t confuse \u201climits\u201d with \u201ctightening\u201d if the end result is a policy mix that suppresses real yields and keeps liquidity conditions easy.</p>\n<p>CoinFund President Christopher Perkins <a href=\"https://x.com/perkinscr97/status/2020654501623976099\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">added</a>: \u201cI continue to think that the crypto markets got the Warsh appointment wrong. A new Fed-Treasury Accord is the plan&#8230;has been all along. Additional coordination, or any shift in responsibilities to <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-explode-bessent-250-billion-deregulation/\" rel=\"noopener \" target=\"_blank\">Scott Bessent</a> and the US Treasury will bullish for crypto IMO&#8211;once things settle. At least for the next 3 years.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>For bitcoin, the central question is the direction of real yields and the credibility of the \u201cindependence\u201d anchor because both feed into how investors price fiat debasement risk and liquidity scarcity.</p>\n<p>The pro-crypto interpretation is consistent: if an accord evolves into a framework that caps parts of the curve or otherwise lowers real yields, it can push capital out the risk-free complex and into assets that behave like inflation hedges or duration substitutes. Bull Theory put it in plain terms: \u201cIf Warsh\u2019s framework leads to lower real yields, rate cuts, and easier liquidity conditions, that usually supports risk assets like equities, gold, and crypto. Because when bond returns fall, capital looks for higher-return alternatives.\u201d</p>\n<p>The caveat is that the same setup could increase volatility in rates markets. Bloomberg flagged that an ambitious accord could spook investors about the Fed\u2019s independence, while Bull Theory argued that reduced Fed support for long-term yields alongside heavy Treasury issuance could steepen the curve and lift term premiums.</p>\n<p>For crypto traders, that combination can create a two-speed regime: supportive liquidity narratives on one hand, and sudden risk-off impulses if bond volatility spills into broader financial conditions.</p>\n<p>At press time, BTC traded at $69,151.</p>\n<img alt=\"Bitcoin price chart\" class=\"size-full wp-image-880583\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/BTCUSDT_2026-02-09_15-39-08.png?resize=1024%2C499\" width=\"1024\" />", "sentiment": "neutral", "categories": "etf,regulation,macro,defi", "coins": "BTC,ETH,LINK"}}

It started near $0.30, but heavy selling pushed it to $0.23, forming a consolidation to $0.26. Amidst strong bearish pressure, new data suggest that major traders have exited their ADA positions.</p>\n<p>Alphractal founder Joao Wedson, for one, said that Cardano&#8217;s derivatives market is going through a major shift that could affect its price momentum.</p>\n<h2>Cardano Follows Solana&#8217;s Path</h2>\n<p>Open interest in ADA has declined sharply from $1.6 billion to $334 million, as major players have aggressively closed their positions. However, Wedson <a href=\"https://x.com/joao_wedson/status/2020606697409278378\">explained</a> that the more important change lies in how OI is distributed across exchanges. In 2023, Binance controlled over 80% of ADA&#8217;s open interest, while 17 other exchanges combined held less than 20%.</p>\n<p>By 2026, that balance has dramatically changed as Binance now holds only 22%, and Gate.io has emerged as the new leader with 31% of the market. Wedson observed that this change is significant because a similar pattern played out with Solana.</p>\n<p>During SOL&#8217;s rally from $20 to $200 in 2023-2024, Binance&#8217;s dominance in open interest increased, thereby supporting price appreciation.</p>\n<p>Later, as Binance&#8217;s share declined, Solana&#8217;s momentum weakened. The same trend appears to be unfolding with Cardano, and with open interest now fragmented, the altcoin&#8217;s upside potential may be limited as the overall crypto market remains fragile.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Binance tends to be the exchange that fuels strong altcoin rallies, but only when leverage is concentrated and competition is limited.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Long-Term Trend Remains Intact</h2>\n<p>Despite the short-term market uncertainty <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/falling-knife-gemini-and-chatgpt-predict-shocking-lows-for-cardanos-ada/\">gripping</a> the ADA market, pseudonymous analyst, &#8216;Crypto Patel,&#8217; <a href=\"https://x.com/CryptoPatel/status/2019992013345603597\">believes</a> that the overall long-term structure stays bullish as long as the price does not fall below $0.13 on a weekly close.</p>\n<p>On the upside, he says ADA needs to reclaim $0.44 to confirm a new uptrend. If that happens, the crypto asset could enter a new bull cycle, and long-term targets range from $1.20 to as high as over $10, similar to past cycles.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/is-cardano-in-trouble-why-whales-are-abandoning-binance/\">Is Cardano in Trouble?

In this model, users can shift counterparty risk to market makers through collateralized debt positions (CDPs), where assets are locked to mint stablecoins.</p>\n<p>He explained that even if 99% of the liquidity is backed by CDP holders who hold negative algorithmic dollars while holding positive ones elsewhere, the ability to offload counterparty risk to a market maker remains an important feature.</p>\n<p>The second, or \u201chard mode,\u201d framework allows for real-world asset (RWA) backing, but only under strict conditions. Buterin said an algorithmic stablecoin backed by RWAs could still qualify as DeFi if it is sufficiently overcollateralized and diversified to survive the failure of any single backing asset.</p>\n<p>Under this structure, the overcollateralization ratio must be more than the maximum share of any individual asset, ensuring the system remains solvent even if one part collapses. This means that it would act as a buffer that distributes risk instead of concentrating it within centralized entities.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like that sort of thing is what we should be aiming more towards,\u201d Buterin said, adding that the long-term goal should be moving away from the dollar as the unit of account toward a more diversified index.</p>\n<h2>Crypto Community Response</h2>\n<p>The remarks were widely supported within the X crypto community, with one user <a href=\"https://x.com/i/status/2020689791772418233\">calling</a> it a \u201cgreat take\u201d and noting that ETH-backed algorithmic stablecoins offer real risk reduction, while RWA diversification spreads it instead of eliminating it. Another commented that &#8220;True DeFi needs real risk innovation, not just USDC parking.\u201d</p>\n<p>However, there were also some concerns. For instance, X user Kyle DH pointed out that algorithmic stablecoins have not updated their designs to address known issues, which makes them similar to money market funds that have the same \u201cbreaking the buck\u201d risks <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/luna-collapses-below-16-as-terrausd-remains-unpegged/\">seen</a> before with TerraUSD and LUNA. They added that RWA backing requires careful diversification, warning that highly correlated assets or black swan events could still cause a stablecoin to fail.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/vitalik-buterin-slams-fake-defi-backs-eth-based-algo-stablecoins/\">Vitalik Buterin Slams \u2018Fake\u2019 DeFi, Backs ETH-Based Algo Stablecoins</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CryptoPotato</a>.</p>", "sentiment": "neutral", "categories": "regulation,macro,defi", "coins": "ETH,SOL,AAVE,MKR"}}
